Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"Real pleased with this rig.  I love the materials and the construction.  The dimensions are just right.  The parts are nice, but they're not as tight as you'd think.  The blades are not really stiff like you'd expect them to be.  There's not a lot of detail in these blades, and they don't have much on them.  I'd rather have a set of Blades and a set of Blades.  I like that the blades are interchangeable, though."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I admit, I was a little skeptical when I first saw this, but it really is a pretty good product. I had a lot of thought and then the instruction booklet came out and it was just as well. It was a little difficult to use, but I think it was worth it. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works great. I am very pleased with it. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Nice size.  Fits perfectly.  Love the added organization  they provide.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open. I can sleep comfortably on my side or back. it comes with a cloth bag for storage."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"When I first received the clip and turned it on, it froze while listening to the radio. I managed to get it unfroze by connecting it to the computer - holding down the power button didn't do anything.

I spent a little time transferring audio files to it, then it went dead completely. Won't turn on. Won't connect to computer.  Submitted it for return to Amazon today and now I have to wait another week to try it again.

Considering I bought some accessories to go with it, if I can't get a functioning mp3 player, I'll be pretty upset at the waste of time and money.

I have a few more that I'll post about in the future. I'll be updating as needed and to make sure I've received all of the information I need for my review. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Thank you. I have not tried this yet but I've had it for a few months and it works great. I like it, but I'm a little afraid to go ahead and buy it again because it's so easy to clean and the smell is gone. But I'll have to wait until the next one comes out to see how it does.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I read a lot of reviews saying this had a small fit, almost an ""athletic fit"". I ordered an XL assuming the shirt would fit like a large. Well it didn't. 5'9"", 180, not skinny but not fat. I can tell you this shirt was huge. Pretty much a XXL. The picture shows the shirt being slim through the body but once i put it on there was lots of sleeve room and I had to bunch up, or fold over, the back of the shirt to make it look like the picture. The collar has some smaller, plastic- diamond studs to hold the collar down and the buttons are nice. I like the color of the shirt and the material was somewhat papery but I'm sure with a wash or two it would have been a softer material. I am to sure how the whole process of making and moving these shirts go, but I guarantee that the shirt I wore was not of the ""smaller fit"" batch some people are getting."

Books_5,5,OR,"This is a classic read for me as it was my first fantasy novel. Hence it is a classic novel for me and very sentimental. I recently hunted down a reprint as I had lost a large volume of my original reads and re read the book. The story is a light fantasy read, but extremely entertaining. The plot and characters are creative, and the writing is descriptive and enjoyable. Lawrence portrays the main character as distinctly human in his attributes and flaws which is a breath of fresh air from other novels. Presenting a character that could be you or me or anyone, thrust into an adventure unwillingly and forced to play the cards as fate deals them. I also enjoy Lawrence' very non-linear and unorthodox story lines. He's very creative with coming up with non-traditional fantasy elements and weaving them together into a very solid story. You can see more of this in his other novels such as ""cyborg and the sorcerers"", or the overman series, but also here as well. I recommend this novel to anyone."

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I saw this movie in theaters and I thought it was great. It was thought-provoking and you see this different side of the handi-capped. The documentary is very touching and uplifting and it's definitely worth seeing. I think it's very truthful and it's only graphic in a few scenes. I don't think it's a movie worth seeing again and again, so maybe you should just rent it instead of buying. Some of the stories in the film are so heartfelt and you really do feel for these guys. There's tons of emotion and in the end, you can't help but feel that there's a bright side to everything."

I have it controlling a Trane XL80 Dual-Stage Gas Furnace w/ Trane XR16 A/C Slim-line Unit.  Dual Stage Furnace works as designed even though this thermostat is manufactured by Honeywell (and is a lot cheaper than the Trane branded thermostats).  Very happy with this Honeywell unit and like the various customization features it offers me.  FYI, the Wi-Fi feature works as they all do; i.e., your smart phone connects to your home wi-fi connection, which then connects to Honeywell's server via the internet, with the Honeywell server then sending your commands back to your home wi-fi connection via the internet, which then communicates directly with the thermostat unit.  Thus, your smartphone interacts with Honeywell's off-site server and not directly within-your-house with your thermostat unit."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"As some of the other reviewers has stated, this is definitely a version 1.0 product.  I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product."

For now, he pushes the caterpillar along the floor, or plays with each of the individual segments if I pull them apart for him. Each of the pieces includes an individual experience for play, with rattles, spinners, and different sounds. My 7 month old loves to tap the pieces together when he has one in each hand. He's also figured out how to push the red heart to get music and blinking lights. My 2 year old loves to build the caterpillar by himself and sings along to the familiar music (Polly Put the Kettle On).

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,I ordered a size up just like one of the reviewers suggested.  Bad idea!  Stick to your size.  Large/xlarge size was so big that i felt like I'm wearing a clown pants.  I was totally swimming in the fleece skirt pants.  Pants is thick not very good material/fabric.  Not what i expected.  Definitely a return.  Giving it 3 stars because it's way too long not meant for shorter than 5'5 in height
Books_5,5,OR,"I love this story. All the characters and the experiences really hit me. My heart hurt when the characters were in pain and I was so happy when they were experiencing joy. I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.

I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.

I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.

I fell completely in love with the concept of snow globe moments. It reminds you to always be present in the experiences while you're in them and to always look for adventure and joy."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I love koralia's and this one has lived up to all my expectations. The size is absolutely perfect, previous generations of the nano were significantly bigger which made them akward for nano and pico tanks.  This one fits in my salty fluval edge perfectly.  The only thing i'd like to note is that both the ""wet"" and ""dry"" magnets look exactly the same, i'm not sure if this was on purpose or not but it did distress me for a while when i was first setting it up and worried about possibly getting it wrong.  The manual states their different but mine looked exactly alike. besides that i say perfect pump."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I was prepared to have low expectations for this sight given it's price when I bought it ($45) and I was pleasantly surprised. I mounted it to a KelTec KSG and so far it's been exactly on target. I have noticed the reticle can get a little blurry and out of focus depending on the angle I look at it. It's also a little hard to see when it's really bright outside even at the highest brightness level. Still, it's quite a lot of functionality and performance for the price. I would definitely buy it again and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap optic for less precise work."

It was practically brand new when he gave it to me. Let me just say that I wish he did not break my old Craftsman saw, because it had a straighter cut then the Rigid. I gave up on it, I have tried everything to adjust this saw right with zero luck. My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage. Sorry, for being a little harsh but this saw is junk in my own opinion for $200. It is not worth more then $100."

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Boss Monster is a light card game for 2-4 players, that takes about 30 minutes (give or take depending on experience and number of players).

In this game, each player takes control of a boss from an 8-bit video game RPG. You must build a fiendish and deadly dungeon, and lure heroes into it with the kind of loot that they like, in order to brutally murder them. You use Room cards to build the dungeon, and Spell cards to aid you (or hinder your opponents). If your dungeon is strong enough, you will kill the heroes and collect them as ""souls"" (points). If the dungeon is too weak, the heroes will break through and wound you. Any boss who takes five wounds is killed and out of the game. But the first boss to survive and gain ten souls is the winner.

This is a solid, fast-paced card game. The theme is fantastic and I love the look of the cards. In fact, everything about the game just screams ""fun"" at first glance, right down to the parody art of famous video games and other pop culture figures. In fact, why the game succeeds is because the theme is tied so strongly to the mechanics, and they blend well, even though it's a very simple game.

It does have some faults. The rulebook could use some work and does not clarify certain basic rules. There's also something of a runaway leader problem (in our game of four, two of us were WAY ahead of the pack by an early point of the game). It's also a game that is already starved for expansions...replay value is questionable.

However, the game itself is very enjoyable for now, and I plan on playing it much more. Kudos to the Brothers for their successful Kickstarter, which amounted to a fine game."

Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2. The other side of the tent isn't lined, the poles which Velcro the cover to the house at the bottom pop off. I really can't say anything nice about this item."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"As with everything, the rechargeable battery will last a long time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in. If you are going to use it for a lot of jobs, it will be a pain. I would recommend using the battery with a strong enough wire. I just put the wire in a little bit and it will be all right. I have no idea how to program it for a lot of jobs, but I'm not going to put it in a shop or garage.

Overall, I was very happy with this product. It is a very good product for the price. I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it at a good distance from your work area.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I was excited to see a new Christian DD book because you don't see very many in the DD world. This book was okay the characters were young and still in high school so at times they came off as very immature. The town they lived in and the school they went to seemed a bit unrealistic, the fact that Ashley's father could go from never spanking her to as harsh as was felt unbelievable. Ashley's character really frustrated me the constant back and forth on her feelings for Jackson, and Jackson was really pushy about getting married. Throughout the book we get to watch them go through marriage classes and that's when it starts to feel like a ""how to"" book. There are only a few spanking scenes in this book and only one between Ashley and Jackson.
I would have liked more of the romance between Ashley and Jackson minus everyone else. A follow up would be nice!"

She had severe diarrhea in the past, and had been eating her food for a few months.  This food has held up well and she seems to be doing well with it. I also use it on my dogs when I am away from them.I love this brand of cat food.  I have tried other brands before, but this one has stood up to my cat's thirst.  She has had it for a couple weeks now"

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,I'm an accidental collector of these since Amazon has made it possible to buy all of my toy purchases for Christmas from my couch. I have to say this one is my favorite. It is very soft and snuggly. My only complaint is mine is a grumpy bear and does not have the same sweet face as the one in the picture.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Very comfortable. Didn't even need breaking it to be perfect fit for my feet.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Over the Christmas holidays, I read several books celebrating the special holiday. This particular book was so touching and brought back some of my childhood Christmas memories. The short stories were all different and unique to the particular author. It was a beautiful look into their lives and most enjoyable."
Kindle_Store_5,1,OR,"What a terrible end to this series.  I loved this character and her gargoyles from the first novella that I read but this book was technical with almost no heart or development for the few characters there were.  I was completely bored with the formation of crystals and what it took to form the crystals.  I felt like I was in a cave forming crystals through out most of the book.  That is what I mean by the book being too technical.  If there was such a thing as gargoyles, this would be the manual on how to make your own gargoyle. The writer spent way too much time on that and not enough time on developing the romance and bringing life to the final story in this series.  I miss the people and the gargoyles from the previous books.  This book felt like a novella that was dragged out."

I use this in my bathroom and laundry room to reach stuff on high shelves and I really like it.  Feels sturdy and well made and does not wobble."
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.  As for us, while we appreciate the Tim Burton like darkness, the story was too bizarre and too violent for us and the kids had us turn it off after the second over the top song, really wish we hadn't purchased thisif you are not sure, may want to rent."

Only 6"" long, so can fit in a back pocket OK.  Waterproof, although I haven't tested this feature.  Requires just one battery, which happens to be a size 18650 not found readily in the USA.  (But can be ordered with charger from Amazon.) I am really impressed with these CREE LED flashlights.  Forget about the 9-LED flashlights, and any old-model incandescent flashlights!  They just don't compare at all to these CREE lights. WOW!  Amazon ships directly from China; about 2 weeks for delivery.  Always well packaged.  btw, buy extra batteries."

I had to return it due to the fact that it was damaged in shipping. I am returning it for a refund.my puppy loves this toy!It's a bit pricey for a small dog but I really like it.

It's very sturdy and sturdy for her.  It's a bit on the smaller side because the handle is a bit too large for her, but she loves it.  She's about 20 lbs and it's just right for her.  I don't know if it's a little too tight or not, but I feel like it fits her well.  I don't have any issues with it breaking apart.My dog loves this bed!  I have 4 of them, so I bought the perfect size for her.  She has a very short chest and it's easy to move around.  She's a very tough chewer, and she's very gentle with it.

Books_5,4,OR,"I liked it . However, I did not understand why the author had the lead character looking down on his mentor for not acting on his suspicions when the main character looked the otherway himself despite the evidence until someone died. Yet he lectured his mentor but does not mention his less than honorable actions and what it took for him to act on his suspisions. Anyway, I do recomend giving it a read."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This horse is amazing! He looks perfect in my collection, I highly recommend this model, I also love how he is in the same pose but different coloring."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Typical RTA product.  Instructions were a little light,OK it was an exploded drawing.  It took about an hour from opening the box to assembled product.  As with all RTA products there is a concern of over tightening something ans either stripping or breaking it.  I'll be placing a safety wire in the back to prevent it from toppling in the event my cat gets rambunctious.  It's still new so my cat needs to get used to this... She likes being high up and the top condo will be perfect.  One caveat, besides the RTA, the lower condo is more suitable for a kitten or small cat.  Mine is 11 lbs and medium size.  This would NOT work fr a LARGE cat.  A large cat could only really use the two larger shelves and would likely topple the entire tower trying to get on the top perch."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Excellent story --- reads like a spy novel thriller, as the cliche goes.  Except this time, it's no cliche. Which is why Luke Harding's book is the basis of the forthcoming movie adaptation directed by Oliver Stone and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden.

Harding's advantage here is that he had a ringside seat as his colleagues at The Guardian were handed this opportunity.  They didn't blow the assignment.  Harding depicts the steely nerve on display here, ranging from Snowden to Guardian colleagues like investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, then-editor Alan Rusbridger and then-deputy editor Janine Gibson."

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I really like this product.  My 9lb pomeranians fit compactly within.  It looks a bit snug for them to sit up but it's workable.  The product is very versatile and we've already used them a few times.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

I wear them to work all the time and they are a perfect size for me.  I have a hard time finding good nursing bras that fit me correctly.  They are a perfect size for me and I like that they do not fall out when I do not wear them for a long time.  I wear a size 10 and they fit perfectly.

It is based on Jungian Psychology and therefore it does discuss a a few things about the matter, but does not enter in the different schools of dream interpretation. If you are into Jungian psychoanalysis this book os for you.

The book gives you tools to approach and interpret your own dreams and to approach and develop Visualization (Creative Imagination, as it is called here) with ease and depth.

I have read The Heart Racer series since the beginning, and I love each and every story but WOW, Marian have out done herself on this one!!!The prologue sets the scene perfectly and I found I didn't want to put it down until I got to the end of the book just so I could see how everything worked out for Kalli. Kalli is a bright, strong-will young lady, who been to hell and back. Yuri is a silent, broody with a cold heart and no compassion young man, who is the VP of the Afxisi club until he meets Kalli.

That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,CG,"Heads up my fellow preggo, it's a very comfortable fit.  I have a wide foot and a wide foot bed and I am a 32D, so I'm a bit large but it's a little snug in the heel.  I'm going to use it as a shoe with no arch support.

I did get a size 10 and it fit perfectly.  I will say that I had to use a size 8 to get it on.  I wear a medium in shoes and I got a size 10.  I really like the fit of this shoe.  I'm glad I got a size 10.  It fits perfectly and looks great.  I am very pleased with this purchase and will definitely be purchasing another pair in the future.Very nice shirt. Very nice. Love it!Nice fit, very comfortable, with good support. I wear a size 8.5, so I ordered a 9. I ordered a 9.5 and it fits perfectly. My wife and I both liked it.The material is soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as I expected.  It's not as dark as the picture would suggest, but it's still nice.  The heel is a little loose on my feet, but it's not a problem.  I like that the shoe has a small zipper that allows you to keep the foot warm.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  The quality is nice.I love this shirt, but I have a lot of issues with my feet, so I'm very sad I ordered a size up. The fit is fine and the material is great, but"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone.
Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome.
The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo.
The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive.
I enjoyed the film and the theme.  It held my interest and kept me watching."

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mattress topper, it turned our bed into a dreamy cloud we never want to leave. Am thinking of getting one for our guest room, would highly recommend, would purchase again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Ordered this as a gift and it arrived on time. I will keep my review for the next
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,CG,"To be honest I was a little disappointed with the quality of the product, but I was pretty impressed with the quality. The plastic parts are solid and the plastic part looks great. The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Okay, I'm a purse snob. I have requirements. For me, a bag must be sturdy, spacious, timeless, and stylish. I bought this bag in July of 2015 and I carried it daily for, seriously, almost TWO years. Yes, the attached pictures are after the almost two years of daily use.
It hasn't lost its shape. There's not a single crack in the handles. It still stands on its own, no matter what I put in it. There are no holes in the lining. And all my zippers still work perfectly.
I don't use my purse as a football, but I'm not nearly as careful with it as I should be. I drop it, I toss textbooks in it and sling it into my front seat. It's indestructible, and CUTE! This is great quality at a great price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have used electric pressure cookers in the past and each one has died within the first year of use when the electronics simply went haywire.  I've wanted to try a stove top model but was hesitant remembering the behemoth my mother used to use.

As soon as I saw the Clipso by T-fal, I knew that it would be the model that I would get the most use out of.  It is large enough for my needs without being too large.  The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand."

by Charles Baxter

While the two have had a lot of fun together, the beginning of the movie is pretty much a family affair. It's a little more serious than some of the other Disney movies, but still a fun ride. The most memorable scene is when the kids are at school and the teacher tells them that there's nothing to do if they go to the library. They're not even allowed to go to the library. The teacher tells them that they can't go to the library if they're not allowed to go. So, they go to the library. The movie is a little too serious and the movie isn't at all realistic. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a realistic ending. The story line is pretty good. The ending is pretty much a joke. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where a story line is completely predictable. The movie is good. The acting is pretty good. The music is good. The acting is pretty good.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I saw The Suitor at the Sacramento French Film Festival this year, and bought the whole collection for the Sacramento Alliance Francaise.  Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.  The film becomes a talkie only when the action takes place after talkies were invented."

Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon)."

Books_5,5,OR,".......during this peculiar political season - make it this one.

The whole thing - every page - from beginning to end is sardonic and ingeniusly written.  The humor is not restricted to just one format.  There are hilarious forms to fill out, games to play and paragraphs that made me flat-out laugh and giggle.

The phrasing and timing of each ""piece"" is perfect and if you can imagine some of these spoofs on the show it's even more hysterical.  But you never need to have seen the show to enjoy this book and I mean just enjoy it - page after hilarious page."
Books_5,5,OR,"I initially found the book slow moving,hard to get into, and actually stopped reading it a couple of times. But, I picked it up again and am delighted that I did. It is the moving story of the life of a soldier, but, more importantly, the life of a man. Helprin's lyrical style, similes and metaphors explore the joys, sorrows, absurdities, loves, victories and defeats of Alessandro Giullani's life while making the reading a pleasure."

I was not expecting such an interesting story, but I was intrigued by the beginning of the story and the end. The book is not in the same league as the first book and is still very good. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I have been reading the series since the first one was released, and I love the characters and their story. I loved the way the story went about getting the books back on the market. I liked the fact that it was not just a series and it was written in a different style, but it was also a great read. I am a big fan of Ms. King, and I hope she continues to write better. I also like the fact that the story is told from the perspective of the characters and their lives.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Loved it!!!

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's. I also love how all the past characters (YES I MEAN YOU SIN!!!! Sigh I love him) interact with all future story's."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"I like this multi-pack as it has the wide opening for two full packs of water. I just use a pair of the open front ones.  The open front one is great for storing water or food.  It has a large storage capacity.  I like the two large pockets for the pockets.  I also like the fact that the compartment is made of several different pockets.  I like the fact that the compartment is made of an adjustable strap.  It's very easy to open and close the compartment.

The included pockets are nice and easy to store.  There's a small pouch that is a good size for water, but it's not big enough to hold a full bladder.  There's a small small pouch for air, but it's not huge enough to hold a full bladder.  It's very small for a small tent.

The tent is very spacious.  It has a wide opening for water.  There are two other compartments that can hold water.  The other compartment is just a smaller one that has a narrower opening that can be used for cooking.  The zipper is a nice feature that keeps the water out of the zipper. "

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I am probably not the most qualified person on Amazon to write a review on headphones/ear buds, but with that said, I LOVE THESE! Since my children are kleptomaniacs regarding anything electronic that Mom has, I only buy the super cheap headphones - the ones available at the gas station, costing $1-2. This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these. (Most of the earphones I've had made Johnny Cash sound like Axl Rose. ) I am truly surprised at how clear these make music sound and how well I can actually understand podcasts and comedy now. It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise. You absolutely cannot go wrong with these - and their low price just elevates them to perfection."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Another top quality product by SKLZ.

I'm using the lateral resistor to train my 8 year old son in speed/agility/quickness. I can also use it myself. The cuffs for the ankles are comfortable and fit children and adults of all sizes. they fasten together with strong velcro that doesn't separate when the product is being used.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

This product doesn't come with its own case, but that doesn't matter because it's small enough to pack with whatever else you're using during speed training.

It comes with a two sided poster and a DVD. The DVD gives you a very good demonstration of several Lateral Resistor moves (in addition to the exercises you can do with other SKLZ products), and the poster gives you a six week program showing you when to perform these moves. One side of the poster is a workout program for the Lateral Resistor. On the other side is a workout program for the resistor plus many of the other SKLZ products.

Every SKLZ SAQ training product comes with the same DVD and the 2nd side of the poster is the same for each product. One side of the poster is always devoted to training with only that product.

I have a mountain hardware hat that works well but does not have an adjustable strap to cinch it down tighter and the brim is smaller than this one. This hat works well to fill the gap for me. The material is definitely light weight without having a fragile too thin feel and the brim is full sized. The adjustable strap on the back is elastic so it has some flex to it and you can cinch it down as tight or loose as you want. One unique thing about this cap is that the adjustment strap has a clasp on it. I will attach a photo. The clasp is thin so it doesnt bother me even when worn under my bicycle helmet and if you have a pony tail you could unclip the strap and then clip it around you pony tail without having to pull it through like you are probably used to. This is the first hat I have seen with this feature. Very clever. The has is made from a synthetic material so it doesnt hold sweat or moisture and drys very quickly as a result. It has ventilation mesh on the sides to help it keep your head cool. It is not the thinnest or lightest hat I own but is close.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Does not work as tartar remover but does give my pug a better minty breath. He didn't mind the taste of the water. It's pug, he will eat or drink just about anything. My cats however will not have anything to do with anywater with this in it. My cat become very obsessed about the faucet very time I wash my hand. They think it's the only source to the water after I put this thing in their drinking water. Tip to pug owner, pug sometimes stink and it's not their breath, it's the stuff stuck under their folded skin so please clean their face more often. Also I bought a stuff call prodent plaqueoff, it's about the only thing really work for tartar removal. Takes a longtime for it to work though."
Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"Decent story aside from the cliffhanger, the book was a nice read for the time and the characters."

The author's research is well researched and well documented.  I highly recommend this book. "
Books_5,3,OR,"Likely my LEAST favorite Daniel Silva -- the main character is going too predictable.  Mr. Silver is an excellent writer, but this novel lacks the quick pace, sharpness, & literary finesse he usually delivers."

The watch itself is a beautiful watch.  The size is perfect.  I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a 23-year-old who wears a size 13.  He will probably be able to wear it for a few more years.  The watch itself is very well made and very comfortable.  The band is sturdy, and the band is very well made.

I guess it's just a good story line.This was a very good book. The characters were well developed. I liked the story and the characters were well developed.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Larger than expected, but if you are familiar with HSGI gear then you will love the soft gel padding. All plate carriers will be more comfortable with this upgrade. If you have to use plate carriers for long periods of time, this is a must-have. Very very comfortable and lightweight. Best shoulder pads on the market, much better than the shellback tactical pads. Those are great too but the soft gel makes a difference."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Look to be well made.  My grandson thinks they're OK....which is high praise.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Great quality delivered in a timely fashion. This product is everything as described and then some. My two Westies do not require such a heavy duty leash. It was my fault for not noticing ""heavy duty"".  However, if your pet is of good size and/or not easy to control this is the leash for you.  I intend to donate the two leashes to a dog rescue in my city. I'm sure they can put it to good use with the verity of abandoned animals they take in."

Electronics_5,3,OR,This cable does not work as an Oculus HDMI headset extension cable.  The headset flickered.  I ended up having to use a different cable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"I figured for $50 I'd buy this blazer for more casual affairs. It looks sharp and nice color ( I got the light blue blazer). I haven't been able to wear it yet because the second I took it out of the packaging I noticed the strong smell of sweet syrup all over the jacket. Instead of returning it, I thought I'd take it to the cleaners. I haven't had time to do that, yet. If it weren't for the smell I'd give it more stars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,Love this ammo case.  We have had the cases for two years now and have not been disappointed
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,Not as easy to collapes as I had hoped. Have to hold on or it gets a little unstable.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought an 8 pack of these and have been replacing the CFL bulbs in the house as they burn out.  I've been much happier with these.  Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.

I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.  They have a nice glow to them rather than the harsh LED light you might be familiar with if you bought some of the earlier or cheap ones.  Try these, you'll love them, save power, and change bulbs much less often.  Win, win, win."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,I keep these on hand and have them on hand. I also keep my lab in a crate.I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very large ear. It was her only ear. I am very pleased with it and will purchase it again

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My child loves these.  They are very sturdy cardboard.  She loves taking the lids on and off.
Electronics_5,1,CG,"I would give it 0 stars. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one time I hooked it up to the TV, it would not connect to the TV. This is because the HDMI cable is in the same location as the one in the TV. If you have the TV plugged into the TV, the HDMI cable will not connect to the TV. If you have the TV plugged into the TV, it will not connect to the TV. It's very frustrating.

I had to hook up the HDMI cable to the TV to get it to work. This is a huge pain and takes a lot of time. I don't want to have to get the TV hooked up to the TV to make it work. It would be nice if there were a way to do that with the other cables.

I have no complaints about this. I would definitely recommend this product.Works as advertised.This is my second pair of Samsung Note 8s, but"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Oh my gosh I was so happy to receive this ARC, in exchange for an honest review.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"Not working well with wink lights. The only light I've tried that didn't work was one that wasn't bright enough to get a full circle of light. This one is very bright and it's a little smaller than the one I was using. This one is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I'll try it with a dimmer. I'll just have to get some wire strippers to go with it. It's very easy to program it to your liking. You can change the brightness from the dimmer to the full circle. There is a small fan in the bottom that doesn't work with the dimmer. It's not a bad deal for this light. I don't know if it's the dimmer's fault or if it was a bad design, but it's"

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"I am a big fan of SCREAM 1 & 2... and I was really hoping that Wes Craven might be able to succeed in this TRIOLOGY but as all triologies fall down... Scream 3 was as bad if not worse!
The scenes of 3 are much weaker than of 1 & 2... the thrill, suspense and surprises are very low!
If you are buying the Boxed set or building Scream library go ahead and buy it... if not don't consider it as it is very disappointing, at least in comparison to the 1 & 2 it failed!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"I use this to tie my ankle bands to my legs.  I also use this to tie my other pair of socks to my shoes.  The fabric is a bit thin, so I wear a small size smaller than the size of the size I would normally wear.  The material is soft and comfortable"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed seeing William take more control of his life and to put himself out there in this part. Jennifer was a little tiresome in this one with how reluctant she was to place her trust in William, even though to me he was clearly very genuine, but this was still an enjoyable read and I look forward to reading the next part soon."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My three-year-old son loves playing with these. All pieces are very well made and sturdy. My son is not a delicate creature, as most boys aren't, but these are standing up very well to his use. The moving parts move very easy and my son has no difficulty using them. They provide him hours of fun while playing with play doh making shapes, stamps and patterns. Anpther great product from Melissa and Doug!"

Books_5,4,OR,"It's a slow burn, but once it heats up this book is hard to put down. Gone Girl gives married couples something to think about and might just scare singles from getting married. It raises the question of who we are when we're with the one we love. Are we really ourselves or are we the person they want us to be."
Books_5,5,OR,"The Darling is a magnificent book, far ranging and very compelling. Russell Banks, like Wally Lamb, writes authentically in the voice of a woman, so much so that it is hard to believe this book was really written by a man.

The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carrington, the darling of the title. What a misnomer! She is anything but darling. Selfish, self-absorbed and admittedly lacking any maternal instinct whatsoever, Hannah is not a sympathetic character, in spite of all she endures, nor even a very likeable one.

This is a story of a political radical's flight to W. Africa and her subsequent marriage to a black Liberian, which results in the births of three children. It is, of course, a tale of politics, race relations, and terrorism. But it is also a story of one woman's efforts to learn about herself and to make a life of value. Whether she ever succeeds at this goal is debatable.

This book made me want to immediately delve into anything written by Russell Banks!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Reading some of the reviews, I was worried that this would be some cheapo piece of plastic that breaks right away but... it's not. I've had one of these types of kickstands on all of the bikes I've ever owned (normally expensive bikes that don't come with their own kickstands) and this one has definitely got to be one of the higher-quality ones. And those other ones lasted me for years.

I LOVE how adjustable it is. I can stand my bike straight up or put it at a pretty good angle without it tipping. I'm 6'1 and have a pretty large bike too.

Bottom line: It's worth the price."

The navy blue is a darker color and the black is a lighter color. I wore them for about an hour and still have no complaints. They are great for lounging around in the house and on the beach. They are very comfortable and look great. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. He is 5'10"", about 165lbs. He is 5'4"", 140lbs. He has had them for a couple months and they have been great. He said they are comfortable, but I would have given them 5 stars if I had not worn them. Very comfortable, it is a little narrow, but I have a very small chest. I have a large chest and it is tight, but not too tight. This is my second pair of this cute leggings. They are very comfortable and fit well. They are soft and comfortable. The color is exactly as I expected. Great, very comfy, I ordered size up as needed.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats. Now I guess it's time to admit that I stopped reading several, ok - lots of, times to 'refresh my memory' LOL!"

It was a very moving story that was told in the style of a true story. I learned so much about the world of the Pony Kingdom. And I love the way it is woven into the story. There is a great sense of danger and love and friendship and friendship and friendship. It was all there in this book.

I loved the way the book was told. I loved the characters. I loved the interactions between them. And I loved the story. It was a very sweet story. And it was a very funny story.

Books_5,3,OR,"H. Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, ""Where's the Beef?""  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know."

It is a great read.This is one of those books that should be read by every family member. I learned a lot about how the country is run and how the people make decisions for themselves. I highly recommend it to any family member. It's very inspiring.I read this book years ago and I thought it would be a great read.  I just read it and loved it.  I have read many of the books in this series"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"Although this item does have a built in case, you can either keep it in the trunk or use a pair of the same size, but the trunk is a bit more sturdy. I like it. It's not waterproof so it stays cold for long periods of time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These Tekton wrench holders are wonderful. They are made of good solid but flexible plastic and will hold most wrench's and spanners. I used them to hold metric and SAE open end, open end ring (combination) and ring spanners and found they tidied up my tool box leaving much more room and making the tools identifiable at a glance. You can cut them to fit and I found a small band saw did the best job but a sharp blade would work as well. I highly recommend these."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Nothing to complain about here.  I love the look and feel of this lamp.  It has a nice touch. 
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"So far it is working great. I changed a few things, were are on day three and the red stage is on the toilet. I first put the red stage where their litter box used to be and kept the extra litter box out.

I have a wide foot, and these are the only ones I can wear all day long. I recommend them.These are my favorite shoes.

They are made of a super soft material that is soft and stretchy, but doesn't cling to my feet. The only reason I gave"
Electronics_5,4,OR,Does the job.  Plenty of room for backups on both my and my spouse's computers.  I would prefer a cable with standard USB on both ends.  I do not like the rather flimsy dual mini connector at the drive end.  I've had this type of connector before and it failed to make a reliable connection after less than a year of use on another brand backup drive.
Books_5,4,OR,Okay so I borrowed this book from a friend because I was tired of buying motivational books that left me still in the same place but by page 3 I felt so guilty for not actually purchasing this book.  Sherri has some great points about the pressures we as women face on a daily basis by putting too much weight on our shoulders.  This book had me shaking my head and talking back to it.  I found myself laughing and wanting to cry.  This book should be on every womans bookshelf! Good Job Sherri
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"This works just as well as a regular shampoo, which is a lot more difficult to get off.

I had to use a cotton pad to get out the holes, and it's just a matter of removing the pad once a week.

I also noticed that once I put the pads in the bathroom, the water just started getting into the holes.

I also noticed that my dogs had trouble getting their teeth cleaned by the shampoo.

This shampoo works better than the regular shampoo, but I'd be happy to use this shampoo for our other dogs!

Overall, it's a great product that my dogs enjoy.I purchased this for my cat for a Christmas gift.  It was a huge success.  She has only one cat and she had no problems with this food.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I'm very pleased with the quality and look of this set and the excellent service!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having.
These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,One pouch of this was just enough to add to our dogs meal for one day. They liked it but one day is not enough to gauge the probiotic effects of the product. I have to say that the packaging is ridiculous and I had to struggle mightily to wrestle the cap off the pouch.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Booties appear to be well made. As cooperative as my dog was through all my multiple attempts to get the booties on his x-small furry feet, it was challenging and took time. He did his best hip-hop dance moves until he realized they weren't coming off."

I had a friend who said that his headphones were ""good"" and his earbuds were ""bad. ""  I was very skeptical. This is a great device for the money. I have used the most expensive headphones and have never had any issues with them. I just can't imagine using a pair of these on my ears with a pair of headphones that don't have the same quality sound as my friends. I'm not complaining about the quality of these headphones, but the fact that they do not have the same sound quality as my friend's was a plus. I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the headphones, but I had no problems. I don't have any complaints with the sound of these."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,This is an awesome product! I got this because I was training my puppy to be okay with car rides and she was having accidents so I got this. Was thing this is a real pain because of the Velcro but make sure you wash on cold and gentle/delicate. I washed it like normal because it seemed so sturdy and nylon but the hems seemed to have shrunk from the warm/hot water. That was my bad for not thinking about the cotton parts of this.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"So normally with cat carriers you have to do a little extra to make sure they can't wiggle out of them. Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied. This carrier comes with a zipper on the side that can't really be secured because it's not a double zipper. I had to zip tie it to the handle and my cat was still giving me a run for my money trying to squeeze out. Too late to return it since it's used, but I wouldn't recommend it for cats, especially sneaky ones."

I highly recommend it to any young kid who loves to play music. This toy is amazing! It's the perfect size for my little girl and she loves it! She loves it.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain."
Books_5,3,OR,"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you."

I have never had this happen before with other collars and would compare it burns left by a cattle prode. Even at a low setting, my dog yelped.

As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."

My main concern is scratching the lens, even using the softest cloths that came with my prescription glasses seem to scratch the lens after awhile. Wish they would use a scratch proof coating as the do with my regular glasses, but than that would increase the price.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.

Books_5,4,OR,"Ever had the feeling while you're reading a book, that you might be sorry you're doing it? That there's something real horrible coming and you don't really dare to enjoy it? I had that feeling the entire time I spent reading this book.

I don't know what I was waiting for. To find I liked one of the characters? Or hated another?

I picked it up because I thought it was some sort of crime novel and then it turned out to be about people - not my usual bag at all.

But I kept reading. It kept me up a few nights, just waiting for the shoe to drop.

And I realized I did like some of the characters. They were all broken in some way and I kind of warmed to them.

And when the shoe dropped I was pleased. And very happy I'd read it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I said just what I needed, and I meant it. This book goes into a lot of detail, however I was particularly interested in the sections on plants that work well, gardening bed ideas, the tools, and reading about the disadvantages. I live in a small but tall building with plenty of room on the roof. The space is not shared, so my wife has always wanted to grow her own vegetables on the roof. She got the idea from an article about urban agriculture, and she always wanted to know more. After I read the book, it was clear that it is perfectly possible, without the disadvantage of the cost mentioned. In my opinion it is affordable, and this book really showed me how. If you are in a similar situation to me, I would recommend reading this to see just how viable raised garden beds are. Thanks."

They clearly take pride in their product.  I told my mom about it and she was bummed that the price was higher than what I had paid. But I honestly think it is worth the price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."

The pullout sprayer works great and I really like having a switch for stream or spray that remains set whether the water is on or not.

I highly recommend reading this to anyone and I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable. For now I will keep looking for a similar product but with better workmanship. Fail."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,This is a great game if you have hours to spare. By now you would think the community chest and chance cards qould either be plastic or laminated.  For tge price of the game i expect those cards to be laminated. Or at least thise cards sold separately aling with houses & hotels. Otherwise your buying a whole new game if you lose the pieces

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!"

I can't wait to see what happens next. I liked the ending. I'm not sure if the next book will be a good one. I have read all of her books and the series has been really good. I was actually not sure if I would like it but I am definitely reading the next one. I can't wait to get the next one. I have read this series by Ava Ellis and I can tell she is one of my favorite authors. She writes the best paranormal books I have read in a long time. I love the characters and the plot.

Books_5,5,CG,"I loved this book. I had to read the first part of it to understand how the author got to the end.  The second part was very interesting, but not so great as the first.  I still found myself wanting to know more about the characters and why they lived their lives.  I found myself wondering what the heck I was getting into when I read the third part.  I just didn't care for it as much as the first one."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again"

So if you're out in the woods on a dark night, you have nothing.  Could be scary and even dangerous.  One note that can be either positive or negative is that the beam is pretty focused, more of a spot than a flood, so you can see far in advance.  I like it, so a positive for me.  Living in AK, I never go anywhere in the winter without a headlight.  Most of the time I only use the low beam, which is plenty to find my way around.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

What's to be said about a book in which the protagonist (a Former Person to the Bolsheviks, Count Rostov to his friends) is under house arrest in a Moscow hotel for 40 years, Nikita Khrushchev plays a very small part, and New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury's overcoat is crucial to the way it all works out?  But the plot isn't the best part -- it is Towles' light-hearted prose style. Though he doesn't let the reader forget the horrors that were occurring outside -- massive starvation, five-year plans that didn't work, World War II -- what is important here is one man's mastery of his circumstances."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,I never saw the original so I guess I don't have that to compare it to like most of the reviews on here. I thought it was a good movie for the most part. A little cliche and predictable at points but there are a million movies out there. It's kind of hard to be completely original. I'm not a crazy movie critic though. I enjoyed sitting down and watching this. My life isn't ruined. It's a movie.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Great product! protected my eyes as needed.  Used for airsoft and took a shot to the face.  Glasses held up perfect.  Glasses don't do well for flat faced people.  Had to use heat gun to heat and bend.  Otherwise would have been a 5 star.  Foam is good fogs up thought like most glasses but after a lot of running around.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Install went smoothly except the intake hoses are quite slim and twisted when trying to attach them.
I read some people had problems with the head not retracting.
I put the old weight on the the hose along with the new one - works for me.

I love the the easy button switch to stop the water temporarily.  Say I want to fill a pot on the counter.  Turn on the water, grab the head, push the stop button, and no splash or wet counters.
 I've had issues with other one handle faucet designs shutting off by themselves.  The faucet I replaced would only stay on if I had the water on full blast.  This handle does not do that.  Now I can peel eggs under water easily.

I can't attest to durability yet, but so far so good."

She has a dog that is on a diet and a hard time eating her food. I wanted to give this product a try because I know that my dog will not eat her food and I am hoping that it will help her because it has the right ingredients. It is a very good product for dogs and I would recommend it to others. I would also recommend it for anyone who has a picky eater. It is very easy to put together and is easy to assemble.

The twists and turns and revelations got the better of me, I finished the book the second day.  I love how Sookie is a pawn and yet, so much more self-possessed and in control in this novel than previous ones.  The series reminds me, the only thing you can count on is change, and the best we can all do is adapt.  Sookie Stackhouse, I hope you live forever!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat was eating Purina Indoor Cat Chow. He was throwing up 1-5 times a day. He had already gone to the vet and they found nothing wrong with him, so before taking him back I thought I'd try switching his food. I bought him Purina Cat Chow Gentle and Purina One Sensitive Systems and this food won. He hasn't thrown up once since he started eating it in the last week. He used to eat a very expensive cat food and he threw that up too (though not as often). I was able to cancel his vet appointment for now and save another $200+ vet bill. I'm glad amazon had it because my local stores only carry at 3. 5lb bag for $8. I have 3 cats to feed so I need large bags. They will eat what he eats."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed watching Valentina and Cesar reunite and discover one another all over again.  Both characters drew me in and made me want to see them happily together.  I loved how Cesar treated Valentina with respect and defended her when she needed it.  I struggled to believe that after waiting so long to find each other they couldn't be a bit more patient with one another as they tried to establish their relationship.  Perhaps because it's a novella rather than a full length story.  Still, I loved both characters and want to see their story go on."

It could be either the reason why my cat first willingly got on it after 3 weeks. And albeit on my bed, it's now still competing with my pillow and comforter and my face for my cat's butt.
The power is really low. Covering a comforter on it all day cannot raise the temperature for me to feel very warm so I doubt it makes a difference for cats who have higher body temperature than human"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"I bought one of these in large to try it out. The label was ""Urban Crews"". After washing it shrunk a little but was not a bad t-shirt for exercise (I like the extra length for stretching (no stomach shows)). I ordered another 2 shirts in XL Only ONE of the two were delivered. The label now said ""FWRD Denim Company"". It is a totally different type of material. Much cheaper and the make is also very cheap (not inexpensive...CHEAP).
So it appears the quality of the shirt you get is VERY haphazard. Is it Urban Crews or some place they farmed it out to.
The FWRD Denim Company shirt is made in Pakistan. It says it is 100% cotton just like the Urban Crew shirt but it does not absorb sweat like cotton. It just drips off like synthetic.
I would NOT recommend these. You have no idea what you will get. I'm going to try a Duluth Trading Company long tail tee. They are $19.50, made in USA and much better quality."

I had to go through the instructions for it to work. I was pretty disappointed. If you want to get a solid solid product, you have to take it apart first. It was hard to get the screws to tighten.

It works great.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs.

I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to use. It was easy to install.

We feared that he was not getting enough water so we purchased this item.  It came fast and was easy to put together.  It came with one filter that will eventually need to be cleaned or replaced.  It is not as loud as I expected after reading other reviews.  I put ours on the bathroom counter for our cat and you can only hear it if you are in the bathroom.  It sounds like a water fountain which I think is nice.  Several people have complimented it not realizing it was a cat water bowl.  The cat loves it and took to it right away.  Now he gets all the water he wants and we don't have to wash our hands under a cat head.  I add water to it every day and wash it once a week which is pretty low maintenance.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This emotionally packed romance had me laughing out loud one moment and crying the next!  The characters are honest, real and very refreshing.  A story about real life troubles in the peerage and the way real people get through them.  While the rules of English edict control,  Bryce writes without all the silly debutante drama found in many historical romances, without shallow characters that can never make up their minds and without pages and pages of explicit love scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I received this book free for review. I am not being compensated or influenced.

I could not put this book down. I devoured it in a matter of an hour and a little bit, and it blew my mind. Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year. Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way. Characters from previous books show up and are mentioned but theres enough context to determine who is who without giving away their stories."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Straps are made for very large person,had to set to smallest size which was a pain."
Books_5,4,OR,"Even though I'm giving this four stars, part of me isn't sure I did like it very much - but that's not because Roberto Saviano's brutal and intense story wasn't interesting (via what seems a very good translation). Mostly, it's because of the nihilism of the cocaine industry, and the pointlessness of trying to do much about it. The cartels have all the power, and the money is so huge that of course they will do anything to maintain it - and frankly, banks probably depend on the cash infusions as well.

So what we're left with is a grim, brutal and horrible look at an industry that does infect our lives probably more than we like to admit. But what can we do about it? Not much. And is being educated/informed about it worth reading about it? I'm really not sure. I feel like I generally knew most of what Saviano wrote about so ably, but he certainly rubbed my nose in these gruesome stories. Is that a good thing? And why? I don't know if I have an answer for that!

I respect Saviano going all-in with this story, though, and just having this book out there is important. So even if a reader is turned off by these horrible stories, at least they have been told. So I don't need to like the story - and I think a reader should just respect the story. As long as that's accomplished, the book did its job - it shouldn't be be 'fun and glamorous' and it is not.

Readers of criminal justice will appreciate this - especially fans of true crime accounts (which I'm generally not, I have to say), so it absolutely has an audience. I'm giving it four stars with some general reservations, but with a solid appreciation for the take-no-prisoners account that Saviano has provided. He hammers the topic home, and it takes all the glamour out of the drug, that's for sure."

However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!"

Books_5,4,OR,"As always, Grisham delivers very captivating story line. Rather than last me for a while as an ""occasional"" read, I blew through this one in just a few short days.  Character development is spot-on, and the depth of information about the challenges faced by Appalachian Miners is very revealing.  I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.  I was also disappointed as I expected some follow-up editorial information/direction regarding the plight of the miners. Was it fully fact-based, an entertaining, yet trumped-up piece of fiction, or something else entirely?"

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Excellent Product for mounting your cell phone to the wall, plenty of room even if your cell phone is in its case. Can be used for all cell phones. Just make sure you read the directions FIRST. But beware unless you have smooth walls it will not adhere, I have rough stucco walls in most of my house and paneling in another part and it will not stick properly. To over come this problem I used Blank Outlet covers made of plastic and than screwed the covers to the wall and installed this product to the blank covers, this method works good for iPhone 4 & 5 and similar sized phones. I know most homes are just sheet-rocked walls and it will work fine."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"While no cat litter is fantastic at least this is organic and does not contain Silica. Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."

The pieces are very well made wooden pieces.  The string could have been a little better quality but overall I still liked it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"UPDATE#2 The tape that is used is not what I'm used to calling VHB. Dropped my hard hat last night and two holders popped off. Do not recommend.  UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."

The register  makes all kinds of sounds, sings, counts calls out items entered etc. This comes with play food items , coins and a plastic card that is slid to turn on and unlock the register . I wish I could share her chuckles and squeals as she plays with this , and exhorts her aunt, uncle and siblings to buy eggs and milk and brown bread.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"(review by my 14 yr old son): I love how the bow can change draw strengths. This allows me to progress to the full draw weight when I get stronger. I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid. I'm just glad they're easily replaced by wisker biskets

Kindle_Store_5,4,CG,"Love, Life and Everything Else (Cora Deleuze's book)

The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.

This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The only thing I would change is that I will be reading more of these stories by this author.I have enjoyed all of the books in this series.  I have read all the books and will continue to do so"

Books_5,1,OR,"I've never read a book that so completely makes a mountain out
of a molehill of non-existent ""evidence."" This book requires
dozens of traitors to be involved(Marshall, Stark, etc. etc.), unless Stinnet thinks FDR
was intercepting and decoding those msgs by his fireside using a English-Japanese dictionary and a copy of the Japanese codes.
The evidence is absolutely overwhelming  and incontrovertible , both from participants as well as Japanese witnesses interviewed
after the war that the author of this book is out to lunch, and trying to make a quick buck with a lurid tale. Even the logic of
allowing the US fleet to be caught unaware makes no sense whatsoever - if the Japanese bomb Pearl arbor, whether it's ready or not, that means war. FDR would have gained absolutely nothing by allowing the attack to succeed. It also could have been far worse had the attack destroyed the fuel farms, which they would have except for Nagumo's trepidation. And that would have put the Pacific Fleet back on the West Coast and immobile for a year. Nor was their any reason to believe that Hitler would declare war on the US as a result, as claimed. The Japanese didn't go to war with Russia (which Hitler strongly wished) just because Japan's partner Germany had. So how is war with Japan going to result in a war with Germany? It depended on Hitler, who had no good reason to declare war on the US. He was stupid to have done so."

I originally decided to try one for just that reason, the ability to clean, but when I look at the precision rings, 20 MOA rails etc. these are very hard too beat and real value for their cost.

Books_5,1,OR,"The story was absoulutly horrible and on a rating from one to ten, it would be a negative five.  It would not be worth a cent, to even a book deprived orphan.
  For starters, it has no plot, whatsoever.  The closet thing to a plot that can be found, if you have the time and patience to look, it that, if your a mermaid, don't be annoying.
  For the mermaid in the story is beyond annoying.  She gets to the point that you just want to wring her scaly neck.  She talks back, is stubburn and rude.  And yet the two main characters in the story LIKE her!
  The story starts with these two incredibally boring girls who (fortunatly) are moving away from each other, soo.  I don't know if I could stand another sentance of ""I'll miss her so much"" or ""I wish I could go back in time.""  They the spoiled mermaid and set her up with this nice guy, who, incrediable, likes her.  It would be more likly that he would be struck by lightning, than to the find and like this mermaid.
  But all bad things can't last for forever, much to my pleasure, and the mermaid goes back to the sea, before dieing from lack of salt (booo!!!).  Then, in the end, the guy must turn into a fish, or something, because he goes out to live witht he mermaid.  They should have just had the mermaid into a fish fillet.

However, if you are a parent who wants to raise a child you can be proud of, then this is a great read. It follows the authors personal experience with raising his three daughters. Unfortunately many parents today can't be bothered teaching and modeling values and positive personal characteristics to their children. Hence, the rise in children living on the edge, crime, disrespect and just plain old poor behavior. As an educator, it is refreshing to read about a dad who sets standards of behavior.

I decided to keep the blankets since there was no defects other than the damp one. I am washing them really good to be on the safe side.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"The kabana does cover the litter box on all sides but I'm not impressed for the cost.  The instructions for assembly were not as clear as needed.  It is not sturdy.  Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust."

Books_5,2,OR,"With its title of ""Fat White Vampire Blues,"" I expected a wild, inventive comedy--an expectation fueled by all those ""Confederacy of Dunces"" comparisons. Well, the book is set in New Orleans and the main character, Jules Duchon, is fat, but these are about the only things Andrew Fox's novel has in common with ""Dunces."" Much of Jules behavior is whiny and annoying, which I could forgive if it was used to greater comic effect, but the laughs just aren't there. Other characters aren't much better: Maureen, another fat white vampire, is a little less irritating than Jules, if only because her appearances are in measured doses; and the antogonist, Malice X, seems an amalgamation of every movie stereotype of black men. Only Doodlebug, Jules' cross-dressing former sidekick, breaths any sort of life into this story, although even s/he can't save the flagging pace of the book's final third. ""FWVB"" isn't totally without merit: The first few chapters were engaging enough to keep me reading. Unfortunately, as the story dragged on it became quite apparent Jules is no Ignatius J. Reilly, and Fox is no John Kennedy Toole."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star."

Books_5,2,OR,"I am a big fan of John Grisham, not only of his legal thrillers but also of his more literary undertakings. ""Playing for Pizza"" was just a huge disappointment for me. It felt like a potboiler Grisham dashed off to justify the expense of an Italian vacation or to make use of some scrap notes he'd made while working on a larger project.

The book's characters are quite 2-D. Ex-NFL quarterback Rick Dockery does undergo a small amount of personal growth in his acceptance of his situation in Italy but that's a pretty minor transformation against a backdrop of predictable stereotypical supporting cast members.

The plot is all but non-existent. It's really a slice of life rather than a true narrative. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Not only is the story line unfinished (that's not a crime, but in this case it's piled on top of the other issues the book presents and adds to the sense of incompletion), it's not clear it would have been interesting had Grisham bothered to bring it to a conclusion.

Overall, it's not only that I expect more of Grisham, it's that I expect more from any good book. This book just doesn't rank as one I'd recommend to anyone."

The locking button (for changing bits) sometimes gets pushed when I'm holding it, and it's inconvenient to increase the speed while I'm using it since the speed buttons are on the other end.

Otherwise it's very useful..."

I just wish it came in a different color for my dog because it is hard to see her from the side of the house. I would have been happy with the medium. I was just too big for my dog and the size is too small for my dog. I have a 14 lb dog and I found this size and it was perfect.

Books_5,3,OR,"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker. This is Clive on cruise control. This is Clive on auto-pilot. This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do. Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi. Get a clue. This is nothing new."

This is I can live with since this is the only bar whose depth fits into the space I have available in my bathroom for a towel bar.  However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now."

It was a great read, and I really enjoyed the characters. The main character, Colton, was very interesting, and I found myself rooting for him to find the killer. It was a great read, and I would recommend it.

I found myself rooting for the characters and I loved how they got together. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great romance.This book was sweet and romantic.  It is the perfect follow up to the first book.  I just couldn't get into it and am glad I did.  I love the characters.  It is a fun read.I have read this author before and she is not my favorite.  I found it a bit hard to believe that she would write this book for me.  I will be reading the next one.  I have not read the first book of this author.  I will not be reading the next one.  The story is about a man who is determined to go after his wife and her children.  He has a strong will and is determined to make a difference.  I loved the chemistry between the two main characters.  I loved how the main character got involved with the main character.  The whole story was believable and kept me on my toes.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter just a month before her 4th birthday. She loves jigsaw puzzles and things like Imaginets, but this was her first game of this sort. It took her a few cards to get a feel for the idea and become more familiar with the objects, but after that she really took off with this game. She completed all of the cards in two sessions, but she continues to ask for it. I think I could have bought a more complicated set from this company (and I plan on it!), but this one has been a great starting point for my daughter. It really is a high quality game with wooden pieces that are a great size for preschoolers to handle. The cards progress in difficulty, and it's quite impressive how many challenges there are using only four pieces. Very clever and perfect for quiet play!"

I do like that it is not heavy duty.  I do like that it is made in the USA.  It is a nice color and I am very happy with it.  I would definitely recommend this product to any cat owner.My dogs love this toy.  They play with it a lot and my dogs love to dig them up.  It's a great way to play with your dog.  It's made of durable plastic so you can take it away when your dog is playing.  It's easy to put on and off.  I don't have to worry about it breaking if it's not on. 
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I would have liked to have much more interaction between Cade and Cecelia. This book is in the romance section but most of the book was about all the different ops going on in the story. And the note at the bottom of the book description about graphic sex? Maybe I'm just biased based on the other books I've read but the 3 scenes I remember (& I don't count one-liner remembering as a sex scene) were not exactly graphic in my opinion.

All that being said, this was a good military romance read, with lots of twists, turns, violence, intrigue, etc.

We have been using them for a few weeks now and it has lasted for hours!  We love the colors and the size and the size of the rubber bands. They hold up well for a long time.

The Thing i am most impressed with in the richness in color and detail in Evie's hair. The dark blue/purple really pop's and both dolls are a great likeness to their Disney Show character's.

While there, she meets Talon and the sparks fly from there.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:

1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.

2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.

3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.

4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations.

The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.

5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge."

Books_5,5,OR,"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.  Well worth anyone's time."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began."

I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price. I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this. The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the cost is a bit higher than other cameras, and the pictures are much better. The camera is very easy to use and easy to use.

People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Being in the dentist's chair is usually an uncomfortable and anxious place to be, but this story turns it around and puts the dentist on the spot. As he pokes and prods with his instruments, he is soon distracted by his patient's new accessory. The doctor has seen plenty of tongue rings but never one quite like this. It's very odd and makes him feel as if someone is watching him. As he continues his examination, he is soon troubled and scared by what he finds.

This story is maybe a fifteen-minute read, but it doesn't short-change the reader that feeling of expectation. There is a nice feeling of suspense for the reader as we wait to see exactly what the good doctor will discover in what is supposed to be a routine exam. From the well-chosen book cover with its unnerving stare to the patient's startling and ominous revelation, it all comes together for a good and kind of creepy read."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.

Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.

Books_5,5,OR,"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.

For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.

Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.

First three chapters of the book are on hikikomori, which are also used to describe the book as a whole, but these chapters have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. It is like two separate books in one.

This is an economic and cultural analysis of  the declining Japanese economy supported by statistics and the author's own views. It also draws stark comparison with South Korea. I had no idea there were such fundamental differences in their economies and people."

Electronics_5,1,OR,"The Battery keeps discharging - almost every time I need to use it, it's dead or near dead.  After a few months of use it will only charge to 90% and once you take if off the USB charger, it drains in about 1 week when not used at all, and when I did attach it and begin using it for a few minutes the charge shows 50%.  I have a DUD !

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Perfect for my 6-7 lb dog. She is snug in there but still can stand up and turn around (it's a tight squeeze when she does). Please note there is no top opening. Only opens on sides. One side unzips all the way around and the other unzips enough for her to stick her head out. The bottom is sturdy and does not sag under her weight.
I purchased this for road trips when we stop to eat and the restaurants aren't always necessarily dog friendly. Seems like it will be perfect for that. We are currently training her to get in and she seems to be adjusting well."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"There's 14 of these now so people should know that THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL ANIMATION.  If you go in expecting the 90's X-men cartoon you will be very disappointed.  This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Anyway let's see some more.  Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, who is next?"

The one problem is this is not a trick you can do close up or in high illumination.  The gimmick is very visible and identifiable.  Also, if you have big hands like I do, let's just say this trick is not for you.  It's made for people with small hands.  So I would have to say I was disappointed with the product.

She had a blast with it, and now it's her favorite thing in the house.  There are many Star Wars figures from the original trilogy and a few from Return of the Jedi, but none have made it to the movies.  This one is great, but I wish there was more.  I like that the helmet is removable, and that the lightsaber is a little smaller.  I love that it has a ""stiff"" edge to it that makes it more realistic, but it's too big for my 3.5 year old.  The helmet does have a ""top"" that makes it easier to stand, but it's a little too small for my 3.5 year old.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller."

Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.

One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,I have had this for a while and just recently the ribbon around the bust got loose in the wash; otherwise it has held up quite well. It is a satiny material and comfortable to sleep in even in tropical climates. Colors remain vibrant and other than the issue listed above it looks new. I would repurchase for sure. If you are larger than a D cup I doubt you would be able to fit the cups but you could always wear a lounging bra with same.

The only thing I wish it had a little more padding is the mesh flap on the back. The flap is a bit too tight, and it will hang out over the edge of the pockets if you use it on something that doesn't have a mesh flap on it. Also, the zipper is very tight, and I would not recommend using it on a backpack, since it won't fit into the front pocket. The case is a good size, and it holds the keys, car keys, etc."

I have to say it's a great movie for kids to watch. I'd recommend it to anyone who has not seen the movie and they will be hooked.This is a great series for kids to watch.

The lighter exercise band when stretched rolled up a few times on me and I would have to unroll and start again.  I guess because I was pulling it out so hard.  The others did fine.  I could feel the tightness with those as I stretched it out.  I may lay flat and try it on my ankles and legs next.  I left out of town so I have not been able to test it that way.  But I assure you, you will feel it in your arms.  I would consider buying these for my neighbor who also wants to work her arm muscles, because I do not want to loan mine out, as I will continue to use the tighter bands."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"When is the next book??  Wow!  This was sooo good!  It was very hard for me to put this book down once I started it.

The story was well written to the point I cried at times.  I could feel the pain and angst the main character, Ana, was going through.  Ana doesnt reveal what happened in her past right away but there were enough hints that I was heartbroken for her.

I was rooting for Ana through the whole book and it was a complete rollercoaster for her (as well as for me!!).

I don't want to give anything away as to what happened with Ana but there is a huge cliffhanger at the end of the book. It was one of those that sucked the air out of my lungs because I couldn't believe what just happened.  It was one of those endings that I had to sit back and give myself some time to digest and figure out what I will read next.  Book 2 isn't currently out or it would be a no brainer what my next book was."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Prob the best cooler in its price range for weekend camping. Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler. That was one of the final selling points to me as coolers loose so much temp through the lids. Nice balance of capacity and portability also, and a drain plug. Wait and you'll see'em down in the low $20s sometime on Amazon and snag some. You'll use them. I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day. It might just make 4 days if really loaded with ice and opened infrequently, but I'd say 3 is more realistic.
After the 3rd day of a camping trip, 80sDay/60snight, 30lbs of ice(3 bags), 3 12 packs (from walk in cooler), 12 pack water (cool basement temp prob high 60s) I still had slushy water to pour out. Cooler was probably opened at least 40 times.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?
I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow."

He likes that it is a little bigger than my pack.  It is very warm and he is able to pack it up in the car with no worries.  I will be buying another one for my daughter.  I have no complaints about this.  We are both on our own and have not had any problems with the product.  Great product.Great buy.

I think if I watched it again, I would be able to follow the story even better. The futuristic story of  Sonmi~451 and Hae-Joo Chang is my favorite.  It's such a powerful love story of two people from different worlds who come together to fuel a revolution. They find love and, in the end, sacrifice themselves for the cause.

We currently feed them a high quality, pure, grain-free dry and wet dog food, so purchasing a case of Science Diet on Amazon was still cheaper than buying from our vet or our local pet shop, and a good value for us.

Our Yorkie is usually a very picky eater and she didn't hesitate to wolf down this new Chicken and Veggie Science Diet dog food with great enthusiasm. We do mix this SD dog food with their $50 a bag Blue Wilderness dry food, so it lasts longer and provides them with all the nutrition they need to stay active and healthy. So far we haven't had any digestive issues and our dogs love it!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I fell in love with James ""Gator"" McNeal as he and his staff of detectives untangle the web of jealously, betrayal and murder of a State Senator in the French Quarter. Who doesn't love New Orleans?  Gator is the son of a Irishman and a beautiful Cajun woman and the lead detective when the body of  State Senator Adam Dupree is found in his hotel room by his secretary. Follow all the twists and turns as he tracks down every lead and every lie to find the truth. What is New Orleans without superstitions, a Voodoo curse and the power of the gris-gris. Gary Graybill has written a winner in my book. Yes there are a few missing words that the proofer missed, under ten I think, I for I'm, but not enough to take away a whole star. I thoroughly enjoyed French Quarter Vendetta and hope to read more of Gators exploits as a New Orleans detective. I did look for another James Gator McNeal story and find this is the first."

This is a very small light and I am not going to have to use the flashlight in my work area. It is not waterproof so it will be very difficult to see through.

I have a number of other lights that I would recommend to anyone who needs more light. They are a bit dimmer than these and I can't see much in the way of light at night. I like the way these dimmers are designed. I like that they have a solar panel so that I can use it with my other lights. I really like that they are not so large that I cannot see in the way of light. The only downside is that they are so small that they are very hard to hold up to the elements."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I really enjoyed reading this book and found myself panting heavily after most the male characters I was introduced to. This story was about Shades & Skylar two very strong and determined characters trying tofind their way back to one another. Their relationship ended on a very abrupt way when Shades chooses theEvil Dead MC over her. Skylar packs her bags and move to Atlanta and meet Rusty, who is a member of the Devil Kings MC and arival club and sworn enemies of the Evil Dead MC.. Skylar finds Rusty murdered in his own bed with her knife and all evidences clearly makes Skylar appear to be guilty therefore; she becomes a target for the Devil Kings MC.The author did an exceptional job with this novel and I love it. I connected very easily with the main characters. I found this book to be fast paced and really enjoyed the scenes between the two of them as they got more and more involved with each other as well as handling difficult situations. I was in a state of suspense and excitement of what would happen next and anxious to turn the page and see how it is going to all work out. Then when the ending came I thought it was well played out and very enjoyable. I highly recommend this story it's definitely a must read!!!"

The only downside is that it is very dark. The flashing light is very bright, so it is not easy to see.

The only downside is that the plastic is not very bright. I have been using a different set of lights for a few years now, and it has never been a problem.

Yet when it finally happened, it wasn't much. In fact, the twist was ridiculous and senseless.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling."

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I have the original game which I love and I thought that I'd buy the other continents for 2 reasons:
1.  others collect all the games so there must be some reason to want more of basically the same game.
2.  I wanted to use it to help my son learn the main places in africa (we used the original one to learn where main towns in the US/Canada were)
and my opinion?
re: reason #1...There is one added dimension, which is fun, and of course a different map that has a lot of cities that I'm unfamiliar with so it really twisted my brain, which is good, I guess.  But overall, I'm not sick of the first game enough to really need a second similar one yet.  If I was in the mood for ticket to ride, I would have just as happily played the first one....
re: reason #2...Although my son over time might become more familiar with some important cities in africa over time and have a basic idea where they would be, I feel that knowing which country they are in is very important and the lines showing the different countries are not there.  Also, many of the cities are ones that I don't feel he NEEDS to know, and finally, it's only the bottom half of the continent.

end opinion: I like the game but wish that I would not have spent so much money on a game that didn't really fulfill my needs.  I wish that it was all of africa, with countries identified, and only the most widely known cities in all of africa."
Books_5,5,CG,"With Mr. Bryson, its not clear what the author's purpose was in writing this book. If he is so inclined, it would be to give readers the opportunity to experience a deeper understanding of the family and its influence in the life of the characters. This is a wonderful book for young people to read as they grow up and develop their own lives and interests. It also provides a good book for adults to read to their children and their families. I loved this book. It was written in a very easy to understand style, and I'm not sure why I was so excited to read it. I like that the story is not over at the end, but the book is written as if it was, and I hope there is a sequel. I also like that it was written in a little more style, as the characters seem more real. I liked how the author used the example of a priest who had a kid with his own problems. I also liked how the author used the word ""con"" to describe the kids. The book was written in a very easy to understand style, and I was excited to read it. I have never read a book that was written in such a simple style, and this book is perfect for that. I will say, I was very impressed with this book. It was very descriptive and well written. I read it because I love the John Grisham series and would love to see this one come to fruition. This was a very easy read, I didn't have to put it down."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light. Place a few of these in some strategic locations, and you'll have no trouble navigating through your darkened house at night. Fumbling in the dark for the light switch will be a thing of the past. You get two for this great price. Have a basement? Get at least two more! Two of these has replaced four of the old style lights for me. I'll never go back!

If you overshoot your desired temp it will take time to cool down and this retains heat well. Would definitely purchase again.

Obviously this is not as easy as a match or lighter, but it worked great and i would highly recommend it especially for someone who knows what they are doing...

My daughter just turned 7 so this game was a little too easy for her, but she still loves it.  This InnoTab game allows children to choose easy or difficult levels. Sofia talks to her friends to get clues to find the door for her class, as they have been changed. Behind the doors are the classes where games are played such as matching game, art class and find the missing pieces. The game has seven learning games and two creative activities to teach counting, colors, patterns, problem solving and more! Definitely fun and educational but I wouldn't recommend for 6 or older, possibly 6 if they still need learning help."

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush.""
Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons.
""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars. I highly recommend this movie if you are someone genuinely interested in understanding the motivations of a Meyer Lansky. He may not be an American hero, but Lansky cannot be ignored if you truly desire to comprehend the difficulties of many to assimilate into our national culture."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great."

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, steamy read.I enjoyed this book. I love how the author wrote the description of the scene where the two were together.

They're too hot to use in warmer weather and once they're wet, they stay wet much longer than my other, comparable socks. This makes sense given they're thicker and would be better suited to colder weather anyway. They're also overpriced for what they are."

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"I was all hyped to watch this movie in the theater and, to me, it was a let down. The movie is about a good, decent, hard working man  called Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) who looses his eldest son to gang rage.  It doesn't end there though--they want more.....
 Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence.  Which way to go????
I will say that his ultra-impressive performances in  ""The Woodsman"" and ""Mystic River"" are nothing like he shows in this movie.  No depth of character for Bacon, which I believe is his bread and butter in the acting field."

Yes, it has plenty of power and will hold the charge through all my projects!  He recommended that I just get a board and put screws in it, then reverse and take out.  I did....I only needed to do that twice before I was all over the inside and outside of my house taking care of those long-awaited projects.

Books_5,1,OR,"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

I never felt a connection to the heroine and then I really didn't like the lies she told her supposed best friend, who had helped her and also set her up with her cousin.  She continues with her lies to the hero and his friends to almost the very end.  This dishonest behavior is from a woman who is portrayed as a devout Christian.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

Books_5,5,OR,"This book is fantastic.  It uses the best training approach, very effective.  It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.  The book is full of not only very specific and well developed training techniques, but it also goes on to give solutions and ideas if a puppy is not learning the desired skill.  I found it extremely practical, far more than other books I bought.  It corresponds and doesn't conflict with the manners and socialization classes we are taking for puppy training.  The progression of skills is very logical, allowing you to train using logical building blocks.  Getting the first series of lessons taught to puppy leads you in a logical sequence to the next chapter.  There is also a great chapter on how to resolve problems such as barking, house training, and all the nusiance behaviors (growling, jumping on your bed, etc).  Easy to read, easy to follow, and I am so happy to have found this book.  Kudos to the author."

Electronics_5,1,OR,"Per other reviews the cloth versions for the G930 don't work properly and the only ones that work correctly is the black one.  Yet, the pillow for the black versions doesn't work for the G930!  Catch-22 for those who have disintegrating pillows and ear pads.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?"

Electronics_5,5,OR,"So far, so good. I've had it for a few months but have only used it a hand full of times. It works well and I haven't had any issues beside with the instructions: they weren't very clear. It appears as though it doesn't work, the first time you use it, unless you press down the button on the back for longer than a few seconds. Other than that, I've had no issues. It works well and a decent price."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"First off, I'm a cable cutter, got tired of paying big $$ for basic tv.  Kept my internet so netflix and amazon are my primary movie outlets.

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more nervous as the antenna is literally paper thin with a black and white side!  Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!  I am very impressed with this and just purchased two more, one for the bedroom and the family room.

The tv I used this antenna on is a 50 inch HD LCD tv."

He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him. He wears a size 7 and a size 8. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. He has already been wearing it for a few months now and it is still holding up well. I am very pleased with this purchase. My son is a size 8 and this is perfect!  He is 6'1"" and it fits him perfect. The material is soft and comfortable. I am very pleased with this purchase. Very comfortable and my son loved it!Bought this for my husband and he was very pleased with it. He is a 36D and wears a medium. I love the color and the fit. It's a nice looking shirt, but not for a 38D. The only negative thing is the material is very stretchy. The fabric is very thin and it would be more comfortable if it were stretchy. It's also very thin and not very comfortable. The only negative thing is the material is very thin and not very comfortable. I would not recommend it for anyone. This is a good quality wallet. I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit. It is very lightweight and it has a very solid outer shell."

The human nature attracts to beautiful woman and strong handsome man. That is the truth. In the wild male bird gets attention from the mate, becuase their feather is shining and their voice is loud. Why Jennifer Garner should marry a fat and no-that-good-looking guy instead of Robe Lowe?

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

Books_5,3,OR,"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages."

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman models. The military ones will start at the lowest setting once activated. The sportsman is just the opposite.

The various colored leds serve various rolls. Red keeps up your night vision, great for not disturbing your partner at night when nature cqlls. Green is the color human eyes are mosr sensative to. The blue is a bit of an anigima. Someone with more detailed info should be refrenced here.

This my 'go to' flashlight. I keep one at my bedside and another in the end table next to my easy chair.

It's hard to find anything to complain about this. I reccomend you get one or two. I know they are expensive but if your safety depends on a good flashlight, do you really want a $5 cheap wally world one?"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"By far the best MTB purchase I've made all year! Ever since i rode my buddy's Cannondale Jekyll with his Rockshox Reverb dropper post, I've always wanted one of my own. With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900. I did tons of research, read lots of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper.

So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawbacks to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offers (100mm compared to many droppers with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just has a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I would suggest the KS eTen to ANYONE looking for a quality dropper post without breaking the bank.

You seemed like such a normal guy, such a hard-working, misunderstood everyman, but with this...dark underbelly.""

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"The first fountain lasted less than 1 month. The cheap plastic part just broke off in my hand when I was cleaning the system for only the 3rd time. The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is."

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."

Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor #2).
The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1).

A great addition to Debbie Macomber's easy reading novels about family and friendships in a small town.
This new addition is a spin-off of sorts from her hugely popular Cedar Cove series which is now televised on Hallmark Channel. The characters at Rose Harbor are as friendly and hospitable as their neighbors in Cedar Cove. The setting revolves around a newly widowed woman who pours all her energy into the Inn which she was supposed to run with her husband. The interesting characters who come by for a visit are sure to delight.

In the second book, Jo Marie continues putting the final touches on the Inn with help from a handyman who doesn't like to talk about himself much. Although she finds him incorrigible at times, they seem to enjoy each other's company. A friendship appears to be in bloom at Rose Harbor Inn."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

An interplanetary crew from Earth, answering a distress signal from another planet, land and get more than they bargained for. Very smart, underplayed and scary.

At times I felt I was watching an episode of a well done Star Trek entry.

Very well done. Worth the rental."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it."

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

I have not used there warranty service but it covers everything except theft and intentional damage for the lifetime of the product.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

There is a lot of potential here for a romance between a nurse and her baby. I loved the way the story went about this mystery. The romance was believable, but the pregnancy was not as great as the other two. I would like to see more of a storyline between the two of them.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Maybe it was just me, but the way this one was written made it really hard for me to get into the story.  I was constantly sighing, rolling my eyes and thinking ""really, please tell you you did NOT just say that!"".  The romance was a one-day instalove that was so corny it wasn't entertaining, believable or even likeable.  The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all."
Kindle_Store_5,3,CG,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

This is a great book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys"

It's not a huge deal for a cat food, but it's not for a cat food. My dog loves these! I have had them for a few years now and they are still very good.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Always looking for something new to read.  When I read the description on this and realized there were additional books by the author Parnell Hall, thought I would read The Baxter Trust to check out the writer's story line.

Sheila Benton; has a trust account that says if she embarasses the family name she will loose her money.  The story opens with Sheila and her boyfriend (who by the way is married) doing drugs.  He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.  Without telling the end of the story and trial, the search for Shelia;s father is unclear ....would I read another book, yes probably."

The front part of the shoe is very tight, and it's very uncomfortable. I tried to get it on, and it was too tight to wear. The shoe also had a hole in the side, so I had to return it. I think the front part of the shoe has a hole in it, but that's not the case with this shoe. The shoe was very comfortable, and I'd recommend it. I'm very happy with this purchase!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I just finished reading this book for the second time.  For me, the true measure of a good book is one that can be read more than once and enjoyed just as much each time.  This book certainly falls into this category.  My only complaint would be the lack of a sequel.  Though the author ended the book in a complete manner, the story could very easily be continued.  Again, the sign of a good read is wishing for the story to continue on."

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"Some films that you used to love, just don't hold up. And this epic soap is one of them. In the acting department, Mercedes Mc. Cambrige walks away with the film, and Carol Baker is extremely effective. I so wanted to love this film all over again, but it's lost a lot of its magic. The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however. For me - I think I've watched it for the last time."
Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,"We have had this for a year which is a pretty good length of time for a bath toy in our house. My boys got this as a gift from a friend for Christmas in 2014. It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has played with this pretty frequently, just sitting it on the ledge of the tub. He mostly pretended, because for it to work it has to be partially in the water. The floating gup that came with this was total crap and grew mold inside it, so I had to throw it out in the first month. The roller ripped in the first week, so out it went too. The rest of the unit has stayed functional, so we kept it. I am careful to squeeze the water out of it until no water squirts out after each bath use. But finally last week,  I noticed the blue tubing looked funny. I cut it open and it was growing black mold inside it. So I cut off the tubing and had to pry the plastic shower head off to get it all off. I then told my kid he could play with the housing like that since now water won't collect in it to grow mold. It is a fun toy, but designed very poorly for emptying. It will grow mold, no matter what you do..... it's just a matter of time."

Books_5,5,OR,"This is a tour de force. Davies stands the  Anglo-Franco-centric stance of most Western historians on its head. He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big  threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance  of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this  book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true. I think a plain, non-verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open-ended play."

She made a great buy choice.  It doesn't run out of batteries quickly and it stays soft and cuddly when being squeezed each night by a little girl.  Good buy!

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well. An old dress shirt can be cut up to make a lifetime supply of cleaning patches - don't waste money on fancy ones."
Books_5,4,OR,This book is written by a man that grew up in the hillbilly culture and understands their thinking and values. His descriptions and reminiscences lead to an easy understanding of the transition to their support of Trump. An excellent read for anyone wanting to know what motivates them and understand the challenges they face in a fast changing world that most of them are not been equipped for. They feel that they are being left behind or left out of the future of our country.

Works seamlessly when both sources are the same resolution (eg both 1080p, or both 1080i) but produces a glitchy output if the input resolutions differ (one 1080i and one 1080p).

Books_5,5,OR,"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people."

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My dogs are 9-lb Chihuahuas, and they LOVE these Buddy Biscuits Soft & Chewy Peanut Butter treats! l like that they are soft and easy for my dogs to chew, and the size is perfect for small breed dogs. Because they are soft treats, my dogs don't leave a pile of crumbs on the floor after eating these treats! I usually give my dogs each a few of these treats right before heading out the door whenever I have to leave the house; because these are peanut butter flavor, my hand doesn't stink like meat right after reaching into the bag to give them to my dogs! Major plus in my book!

I've also purchased a few others. I've only used one bat, but I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a good value, and I can't imagine spending a lot more money on one.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very comfortable. I've used it with a stick, and it doesn't seem to be that bad.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" has Argentina made such an amazing movie.  Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone.  There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begins high over a soccer (football) stadium, pans down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowels of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY.  Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that as it was happening.  Anyway, back to the story...it's epic.  Told somewhat in flashback, it covers over 30 years in the life of a government employee whose life was altered dramatically over choices made in his youth.  I can't tell you anymore of the plot, but I can tell you that you should definitely SEE THIS MOVIE!!  It's well worth it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,A beautifully written book about a much maligned character who I always knew was so much deeper than he first appears. The way Lindsay has woven the threads we have only glimpsed in the past is a tribute to her skill and heart. Her new heroine is more than a match for him and their relationship reminds me so much of Ridge and Sardelle in its depth. I fervently hope that she will continue to write about them in the future as I am loathe to have this world and these stories end.

I'm hoping her younger sister will be able to use the smaller pairs (depending on her size/season), as they are all still in great condition despite wearing and washing them all one summer each (growth is our only reason to replace, as she hasn't worn out a pair yet).

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"3.5 stars
This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I love the P&P continuance stories and there are so few compared to the ""What if's "" that I am thrilled everytime I find one. This book did not dissappoint. Romantic, passionate and thrilling read. Loved this Elizabeth and Darcy. The plot was plausible and so were their reactions.

Loved how Elizabeth coaxed Darcy by humour and other means of persuasion rather than being insulted or timid.

The story begins as they leave their wedding breakfast and the night does not end well. The next morning comes with reconciliation and their bond grows stronger until a message is sent to Darcy from his former mistress brother. Instead of confiding in Elizabeth, he tries to manage the escalating problems on his own but Elizabeth is on to him...

Really loved this book and would love a sequal to see how Georgiana and Kitty got along. Their stories are left hanging. And of course, I can never get enough of ODC...

Heartily recommend this book!"

I love the color and the size.  It is a solid glass container. 
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Leigh finally has to face the fact that she does indeed have feelings for Ryan that go deeper than surface lust. But she's still a girl who does her best to stay rooted in reality, and without concrete answers about where Ryan came from, it's difficult for Leigh to let go and fully trust the man who has her heart.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming elements of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scenes and seriously swoon-worthy actions by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K. Munt delivers another memorable book hunk that rivals Tristan from her well-known Fairytail Saga. This is the kind of romance that should be accompanied by a folding fan."

Mercy does what she does best, protecting those who need protection, creating a situation that puts the pack in danger and has Adam take action.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I've always been a sucker for a bad boy who comes back to a town from his youth and tries to makes up for past mistakes! This is such a book. But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him. I love this book and all the characters were fantastic! I can't wait for the next book in the series!"

The widescreen print looks very good and is in color. I mention this because when I was growing up in the 60's we had a black and white TV set and watching this DVD was the first time I saw this film in color!

Like other Warner releases there isn't any extras, but a trailer. The price is steep, but Warner does run specials, which can bring the price down between $12.00 and $14.00. If you want the film at a reasonable price, wait until they run a sale."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,PROS:  tried this wanting to say it was a good flashlight but it didn't work. I bought two of the same. I also bought the T20 version of this flashlight that I have had in the past. The T20 version is very compact and gives you a great light. I have also tried the T20 version with the T40 and T40-6 and I have had them both work as well as the T40-6. I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter. I had a few of these flashlights that I have tried but the T40-6 is very good for this kind of flashlight. I have had two of these flashlights that I have used for a few years and they are very good.

What a great main character for this story. I never give out spoilers or rehash the books description.  That said even though it's in the Heaven sent series, it's not related to any of the characters in book one.  This story stands on its own.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day."

I've had no problems with this being broken. My grandson is almost 3 and loves to play with it. It's very well made and really fun. I would recommend this to anyone.

Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"A lot more cost-effective than dropping hundreds on a CycleOps or Kinetic trainer if you're just using it for basic cardio. No frills, just a basic mag trainer that works well enough for daily use. Some of the hardware is plastic, and the resistance adjuster is awkward, but who cares... the thing is cheap and it works."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"

Books_5,4,OR,"This book was great in revealing what it's like to be in a violent and abusive relationship and stuck. Eventually mother and son go into hiding in which I can just feel their pain in having to start over in a place where they have no friends or family; no support and live in fear. How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position. It boils down to being a no-win situation to some degree. While some people did not like the ending, I did. I thought it was realistic and really does capture what's there at the end of the road."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Party of Three: Sunday Night Dinner Club book 1 by Jess Dee is the beginning of a new series and what a terrific start. I loved the main characters of Spencer, Chelsea and Levi, but I actually found myself a bit torn at first on whether I wanted all three of them together. I adored Spencer right from the start, maybe it had something to do with him being an Accountant, lol :) Of course, that soon passed as I love when best friends share the same woman. The sex scenes were scorching hot and I enjoyed the fact that Spencer and Levi were able to discuss their feelings for Chelsea with each other. I also liked that this story introduced secondary characters who are long-time friends and I loved the close friendship that was portrayed and the fun bantering. I am really looking forward to all the stories in this series."

If I had to guess, I'd say this is the best dog bone I've found for the price. This is a great product for dogs that need something to chew on. I love that it is made in the USA. I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 lb. lab mix, and I like this collar to allow him to chase his prey, and also to let him know when he is ready to return. It also seems to help him get a good grip on the leash. I would recommend this collar for dogs who need to be able to stay in a leash. I have a large dog, and he is always chasing after his prey. He is very strong, and this collar is a great option for him. He is also very playful with it. It is very easy to adjust, and he gets to it quickly."

Books_5,5,OR,"Terry Pratchett is just about my favorite author.  I'm not familiar with Neil Gaiman.  They make a wonderful team.  Terry is a brilliant satirist and his characters invariably involve other realities and species.  Yes it is another book about the struggle between good and evil yet in this version you get to poke fun at all of it.  Full of surprising twists, in typical Pratchett form, he will keep you reading way past your bedtime."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies."

As detectives or spies, neither of them amount to much.  They cannot even trace a vehicle, though they seem to know this is possible.  And they go off half cocked and unprepared.  Even down into a mine without a map or a clue, followed by elves with guns.  The resolution, i.e. the identity of the bad guy, is contrived.  He doesn't exist in the plot until the end.

But it has some issues.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

But I discovered that once a station was program into the radio there was no way to blank it out. All you can do is program another station in that pre-set. In other words there was no way to clear all or any of the pre-sets. I tried and tried all to no avail.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two."

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

There are not a lot of by products in it, only what any cat needs to thrive. I love the fact that you can buy individual flavors on Amazon. Most stores only sell the mixed flavor boxes.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost."

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).
  Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?
  Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).
  One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports. Came with 2 5ft. Ethernet cables.  BTW, sound fading problem has disappeared, thanks to this great product!"

Books_5,5,CG,So I've been reading this book for the last two years and it's always a pleasure to read. I had a friend who was a social worker and she had a lot of fun reading this book. It was a very interesting story about the lives of people living in the south. It was a great read. I read it several times over the course of a month and it made me want to get back to it. I'm looking forward to getting back to it. I have read all of her books and the series has been really good. I was actually not sure if this was a good book but it definitely was. I read this book first to get the idea of the book and now to get to the actual content. I can tell you I was a little worried that this book would be the last book in the series but I was glad I didn't. It was really well written and really kept you guessing as to who was who. I really enjoyed the interaction between the main characters and their personalities. I loved the idea that they were so different that it was possible for them to be very different and that I would like them to be together. I was really hoping that the story would have been longer and I think that is the case and I am glad that I did. I was also hoping that there would be more depth to the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm happy I read it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed this book. It is a very good read and I have read the entire series.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Good for trapping litter when my guys jump out of the box. I do wish it was a little bigger as I have large cats - not fat, just big. However that's on me for not paying attention to the size. Works as described. Traps the litter. I just shake it out back into the litter box once a week. Now there's less tracking going on."

If you have a pet who is prone to allergies, this may be a good product.

If you are looking to avoid choking on pet food, try this.

I have tried it on my cats and no one seems to have a problem. I have had to use a second bag of this product. I just put it on the floor and it is on my floor and it smells very good.

I have also tried other products, but this one has been on my floor for a few months and has not been choking. I have used it on my dogs and my cats. I am very happy with this product and would recommend to anyone.This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be.  He is very active and has not gotten into the crate and there is no pain or discomfort in his neck.

I am not sure if it is a good product for me, but if I get one I will update. I will update if it does not fit my hips. I have a long time that does not have a problem with this product. I love these socks. They fit my feet perfectly and are very comfortable. I wear them to work, it is nice that they have a little padding to keep my feet from getting wet. I wear them everyday and they are very well made. I would buy again. I had purchased the Leupold One for my wife and she loves it. She wears it to her gym and it keeps her feet warm. The material is very durable and very comfortable to wear. The size fits me and I can wear it all day long. The fabric is very soft and elastic.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,CG,Strap was sized for a woman. The wide knee part of the shoe is just too wide and the bottom part of the shoe is a bit too loose.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way)."

Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I use this with the larger size bowl, but the smaller one makes a nice extra cup for my purse or glove department. With the bottle, it does bounce on my leg while walking, but not enough that I notice it. It's really nice to use on a walk.

06/15/15 I'm changing my rating from five stars to three because the water bottle now falls out of the loop. I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.

Maybe if attached to something that doesn't bounce as much, such as a knapsack, it would still work fine. But I only use a fanny pack when walking my dog, so it's attached to that."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is one of the best books I have read. The way the story went back and forth in time was great in explaining the background of the three women.  I think most people know or have known women like Odette, Clarice, and Barbara Jean.  The bond among the women was amazing & it kept them strong.  Mr. Moore has great insight into their lives & wrote a delightful story . His family must be lots of fun to give him such good story material.

But I wanted to give the boys a little more variety, so I bought another set with crazy slides and spinning things.. it was terrible.  The marbles that it needed weren't ""standard size"", so you could only use what came with it, and the plastic was flimsy.  I tried another set, from an expensive European company.  That was horrible.  So I'm back to this one again, and we can connect them all together to form a huge marble run. We're having a lot of fun with this.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"When I was a child, I devoured Isaac Asimov's books -- especially his Robot and Foundation books, which he ended up combining near the end of his life. As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies."

It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.

If you're looking for something a little different and a bit more unique, I'd recommend this one. I didn't think this was going to be a great movie. I was expecting more. I expected a good, thoughtful story."

This is a very well made pair of cycling gloves. The size is perfect and the quality is good. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered this to add to my core fitness program. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very comfortable to wear and is very light weight. The color is a little too pink for my tastes. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 165 lbs. The straps are not too tight. The sleeve is a little thick but that's okay."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,CG,"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog. Some people think it's ok to give some food to your dog and others say it's ok to give them a treat. If you have a dog with a long mouth or a sensitive stomach, I think that's fine. If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit. I've found that having a dog with a sensitive stomach is not as important to your dog as having a hard body and to a dog that is sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest. My dog also likes some of the soft treats she gets but she doesn't like the soft ones."

It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available."

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"RC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review. Taming Alaska was amazing!! It was a thrilling page-turner with well-developed, witty characters. Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot."

He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal."

This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance. The sex was typical for these types of manlove books. I was just annoy cause it didn't connect or update on any of the other books in the series. Really this is not a series!!!!

After the intriguing start, it was a long ride for me. There were a few moments when I wanted to jump in the story. Not that I was disappointed. The chemistry between the characters was well written and the chemistry between the main characters was hot and steamy. The storyline was well written. I liked the characters and I enjoyed the interaction between them. There was also a lot of plot twist and turns. I liked the story. It was an interesting read and I'm glad it ended. I enjoyed the romance between the two main characters. I liked that the main character was a little more mature. I like that the story flowed nicely and kept my interest. I did like that the book was longer than I thought. I loved the story and didn't like the ending. I was a little disappointed that the book ended in a cliffhanger. I wish it had been longer.

Overall I was a happy reader and a happy book.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"On the box it smells heavenly. But as I suspected, when it burns the scent is more like a burning perfume. Not as delicate as other incenses that I tried. This is just my opinion.
I keep them in my drawers and closet, and they scent beautifully without the need of lighten them!"
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The plot is as simple as they come -- rescue the hostages -- but, as with movies like Jaws or The Edge, the thing that captivates is the interaction between the characters, all of whom seem surprisingly three-dimensional.  The dialogue is stilted to modern ears, but well represents 19th century verbal cadences.  The savages are savage indeed, and one scene was very difficult to watch.  I don't know enough about the frontier to know if any groups like this actually existed in America, and something in me is uncomfortable with the portrayal of any indigenous people groups as so sub-human.  Nevertheless, wow, what a horrifying clan, almost on a par with the Predator."

She seemed to be rebellious because how her father treated her.  Why did he treat her that way?  I believe he was authoritarian with out the hand of love.  How hurtful the story is and Mattie's leaving causes much pain.  Does Mattie get her happy ever after???  Does she find herself???  Will she succeed in the Englischer world???

Kindle_Store_5,1,OR,"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me. Might as well tell me his tragic backstory of bowel movements."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,CG,"Due to the circumstances and the financial problems with the film, it's difficult to imagine what the film is going to be like. The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent. The film also has a very good cast, and it has a very good ending. I think the ending is a good one, and I'm not sure if that's because it's a good ending, or if it's just because it's the ending. I think the ending is a little confusing, and that's what makes it a little more confusing. If you want to see a movie that is full of action and laughs, I recommend this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one. I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action. It's a good movie, but not one that you'll be very happy with. It's a lot of fun to watch and there is a lot of action in it. The plot is a bit complex, but I really enjoyed it. The acting is excellent and the plot is a bit convoluted.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Its easy to put together. No more hard water, flouride, etc. Im using one filter at the moment. I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

In the end we'll collect this one just like the others. We have a whole shelf of Scooby movies and shows. Since this one has already been watched a couple times it's definitely going up on that keeper shelf!"
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"While struggling to find an adjective to describe this book - the word that sprang to mind was 'childish'.
It reads like the author read a book entitled 'How to write a novel' - then tried to cram all the 'hints' into this book.
The plot is (basically) OK - but the telling of the tale is infantile.
The reader could constantly feel that the author was 'talking down' to them.
Many of the scenarios and occurrences are truly laughable (laugh-out-aloud laughable) in their improbability.....
Then there's the annoying - and silly - open-ended 'ending' ---- leaving the entire rationale of the tome unexplained."

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"These bags are much larger than I expected them to be.  It's been a while since I've purchased some, but I don't recall them being so big. They do the job! Makes picking up the pup's messes a lot easier, and a whole lot more sanitary. Especially for my elderly father.  He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness. Some I've purchased in the past were a little thinner than these. If you have a pooch you need to pick up after, these are great to have on hand. They do have a slight odor, but I think it's just the plastic itself. It's not terrible, but is noticeable upon opening the box. They aren't scented with perfume, thank goodness!  I was able to purchase these bags at a discount, not free, for testing and review. Regardless of price paid, it has no bearing on my actual opinion of the product. I rate 1-5, and rate 5 when I would purchase again."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake."

Electronics_5,3,OR,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink."

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I've read the series from book #1 ... and enjoyed as a series of light / quick reads.  There is a decent plot line and the story does move well.  Unfortunately, the editing, spelling, grammar, consistency of names, etc. is absolutely deplorable.  I feel Jaden Skye has an excellent talent for coming up with the series / story plot, but clearly cannot edit or word process his own work.

Jaden:  Hire an editor!

I have found errors in many Kindle Books that I've read ... perhaps one maybe two in a given publication.  And I can live with that.  But not like this.

Amazon should do something ... require a standard level of text quality or require an author to pay Amazon for an edit check prior to publishing.  AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THIS QUALITY LEVEL.

Part of me is sorry that I bought the whole series."
Books_5,2,OR,"This was my first (and last) Michael Connelly book. It moved too slow. Connelly obviously knows a lot about inside workings of a police detective because the time spent on trivia was a large part of the book. There was just way, way too many words wasted describing going to work and how police procedures worked or how the hero traveled from one location to another. Or her paddle boarding. Delete it and just say she went paddle boarding and returned. I don't care about how to wax a paddle board. Or the dog that was hers but did nothing to add to the plot of the book. Why bother to have a dog in the story? Or the grandmother? Do you get my drift? There's just a lot of pointless filler in this book.

I read other reviews saying it started slowly so I gave it time to get to the action, but there really wasn't much action. I listened to the unabridged audio version, which was 9 hours 23 minutes long. If ever a book would benefit from abridging, it would be this one, but then it would only be 3 hours long."

French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."

Gina is not an investigator, but she has already been following her cheating spouse and that woman with great success for all the good it did.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.

I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.

The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings."

The story starts with a young girl sitting in a bar and a man who seems to be an alcoholic.

I have never read any of the other books in the series and I have not read any of the other stories in this series. This book is very interesting and I would recommend it to anyone.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product. I do wish they were less expensive; but we need them, so we buy them."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I find this Norpro 4-Piece Core set to be very comfortable for a lot of work. The extra space provided by the Core set is a good value, and the cover is very sturdy. The only complaint I have is that the coffee is very hot and gets a little hot in the middle. I have to order it in a larger size and it is a little heavier than I expected. This coffee maker is a great value. I have a Norpro coffee maker that uses a larger size coffee maker, so I would highly recommend this one. I have a Norpro Cuisinart Cuisinart Coffee Maker, but I can't find another coffee maker that I can buy this at a reasonable price. It is a great coffee maker and I would highly recommend it. I would also recommend this as a gift for a friend. She loves this coffee maker. I would highly recommend this coffee maker. My only complaint is that the cover on the lid is loose. I was very disappointed with the color of the cover. I would have ordered a different cover."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,This float is big...in a good way. It's very sturdy and holds my 4 1/2 month old son very well. He likes the toys that are included but I stick the foam ones on the side of the shower wall during his bath to help entertain him. They also help me to teach him a few primary colors. The canopy is adjustable and keeps the sun off of him nicely. Well worth the money.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"The colors are awesome, extremely comfortable. I ordered the ""baja"" and just a heads up, they're each custom so the pattern won't be exact. Also not as thick as the photos, but STILL very beautiful and very comfortable. I'll probably be getting them in another color. My size 8 was a little snug so I'll try a 9 for that ""slipper"" feel."
Books_5,3,OR,"I have never written a review before, but this book irritated me.  Entirely too much internal dialogue.  All 6 books leading up to this one were forward moving, action packed, weaving new sub-plots... not this one.  Like other reviewers I grew really tired of Mac and her immaturity (even though she tried to evolve out of it), and such strong emotions being dumped all together.  The emotional roller coaster finally made me motion sick.  I got really tired of the inside of Mac's head.  Dont ""tell"" me how she feels, ""show"" me how she feels.  And frankly, after 27 pages, i really ""don't give a frog.""  Actually, halfway through the last book I really didn't care what happened to anyone.  Not a good sign after 6 books (which I loved).
I think the series went too long, so the amount of backtracking that had to be done to allow for people who are too lazy to start at the beginning got really tiring.  I felt the for-shadowing for Barrows return was heavy handed so I didn't mourn his death at all, I just thought ""You Idiot!  He TOLD you don't expect things to die!"" and then was frustrated that she didn't hang around and defend his body so it wasn't eaten by the locals. If this was someone I cared so much for, and I thought there was the slightest chance he could come back, i would stand there spear in hand until his head rotted off. Highly unbelievable character actions.
I so loved the Highlander series that I was super happy she wove the characters into this one. I was glad to hear from the MacKeltars and Adam and all them.
In all, I felt the story ended too abruptly, slamming on the brakes and throwing me into the dashboard. I leave the series battered, bruised and sorely needing a dramamine."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"I bought these for running, hiking, and hiking. I also love that they are easier to use. I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it should be easy to adjust. It will be a pain to use them again. I would definitely recommend them to a friend."

Books_5,5,OR,"This series of books by ""Lemony Snicket"" does not have the standard ""happy ending"" of most children's books. The 3 kids in the stories (newly orphaned) have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another. To make matters worse, their ""uncle"" - bad guy Count Olaf - wants their money and is always after them.  He and his evil minions are forever plaguing the lives of the Baudelaire children and cause constant mayhem.

Because of all this misery, I thought my 8-year-old son wouldn't like them - wrong! He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter! The writing is dry, but funny with loads of humor (much is directed to adults). The books contain many ""large"" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text (which can get annoying). I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 14 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats). As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!

The story is definitely moving along toward conclusion and we should have all the answers by book 13 (very appropriate!).  Readers will enjoy the series more if they are able to read the books in order as they build on each other - so this collection will be perfect for those new to the series - and the price is super."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.

There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.

The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.

Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.

So enjoy this movie for what it is. I do."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This was my third novel by author Lorraine Carey. I was expecting that same Classic Style of adventure, but in Out of the Ashes I found Carey had exhibited her ability to add a twist on that old Classic style using rich Native American legends with the paranormal. Dean Banks is a teen who lives out west and is not your normal teen . He inherits the ability to have superhuman powers from an ancient Apache shaman as he alone must destroy it before it destroys a centuries old gold mine. I loved how his bravery and strong sense of spirituality were brought out in this novel. There is a touch of soft romance here that will warm your heart.. I think this is bound to be the best seller for young adults.

Im standing and clapping right now.
Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.
Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost."

Books_5,5,OR,"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.
This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Our puppy LOVED this duck- being a duck dog himself, he bonded with this duck immediately.  They were the best of buds.  Mr. Mallard was our puppy's go-to toy for quite a while.  It was easy to wash and pretty dang cute, too.  That is, until our pup hit puberty and learned that he could destroy things.  Mr, Mallard here lasted longer that I expected he would.  He put up a pretty good fight against the shark-tooth puppy.  But it was only a matter of time...

So much so that I'm completely re wiring all of the projects in my Wrangler with this. As far as I can tell this is a true 16awg and the wire strips and cuts evenly, not the thin flimsy cheap copper coated aluminum crap. Good for current, good for speakers, you name it.

Yes, the jacket makes the wire run heavier and thicker and takes up more space in a run of loom, but I'd rather have the extra protection under the hood or beneath my vehicle or around my house.

But if you like this movie, buy it.  It's a lot of fun.I thought this was going to be one of the best shows ever made.  The acting was superb, the direction was perfect, and the production values were top notch.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has never seen or heard of the show.  If you're a fan of the show, then this is the show for you.  And if you're not a fan of the show, then you will love this show.  I can't wait for the next season of this show.

When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection. Sad the manufacturer's for most of these headsets use inadequate cups out of the box. Anyways, these gelpacks will provide a much better seal and help save your hearing. Be well, be safe."

To be 100% fair, I received this product at a free or reduced price in exchange for a fair and honest review. If I find that a product does not meet my minimum expectations for what it was designed to do, For Example a medical Kit that does not have the proper equipment to do what it says it can yet at least has some value, it is generally a 2-3 Star.

Oh, my, the writing. I'm not sure how I feel about this story. I had a lot of fun with the characters and the plot. I enjoyed the banter between the main characters. I'm not sure why I didn't like the characters in this book. They were likable, the banter was entertaining and the ending was sweet.

Books_5,5,CG,"Merton's journal published just five years ago, ""Waking Up"" by Stephanie Plum, was one of the first stories I read. The story took place in a small town in the United States, and was told by a young woman named Mary. The story was told by two young women, and a man named Robert. I learned that Mary had a child named Henry, and had a son named James. This story was told by Mary and Robert, and it was told by a young man named John, who had a son named Henry, and a son named John, who was named John. I had read the book several times, and it was wonderful. I found it a lot more interesting than I would have imagined, and I hope that Mary and Robert will continue to write about their stories.

Mary Plum is a very good storyteller, and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the world of the time.

Luckily, we have all the main characters now. These are not cheap knock off versions of the Nick Jr characters, they are the same ones you find at toy stores or big box stores.

Break Me ended in a small cliffy to start this book up with Rachel finding out she is pregnant. Is it Kellan's or someone's else?  No spoilers here so you will just have to see.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another."

Books_5,4,OR,"TRUNK MUSIC is the fifth Harry Bosch detective novel and may be the best of the series so far. Mr. Connelly writes sharp dialogue and page-turning narrative. Beyond writing mechanics, the creation of hard-boiled detective Bosch is what makes the series so interesting. Because Harry Bosch is so interesting. Set in LA and Las Vegas, TRUNK MUSIC gets the reader involved in Hollywood slease, police corruption and mob antics on the way to solving the murder of a man left in the trunk of his car (hence ""trunk music""). I am getting a bit tired with Harry Bosch getting in trouble with his police bosses and IAD (Internal Affairs Division) and his fellow detectives suspecting him of being a rogue cop. I mean, Harry has solved many murders brilliantly and, by now, they should be trusting him more. So it seems a little unrealistic that they still come down hard on him for doing his job. Perhaps Mr. Connelly will see the logical flaw in the plot there and correct that with different plot complications and tensions in future Harry Bosch books. I don't know but maybe I'll find out in the sixth Harry Bosch story, ANGELS FLIGHT. Such nit-picking aside, TRUNK MUSIC is music to my ears."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

He is much smaller than I thought he would be, he looks cheap, his facial features are not placed in a way that looks normal, his head was not sewn correctly so it is crooked and smashed on one side. I kept him because my child specifically asked Santa for this character in a doll or stuffed version and I couldn't find another of any kind of this character.  My child loves him with all of his imperfections so it was not a waste of my money. The material and stitching are sturdy and he has held up very well with being handled and a constant companion to my child.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are exactly what I was looking for!
They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading.

The only downside is that the range is a bit narrow.  The TV is not wide enough, so that means it takes up a lot of space.  I wish it had a bit more width for the corners.  I have a 2.5"" Sony LCD TV with a Sony projector and the Sony speakers are great.  I wish there was more on the way.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.  I would have liked the fact that the TV is a little longer than I would have liked.

Overall, this is a great buy and I would recommend it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sony TV for a very reasonable price.I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a little smaller than the typical keyboard, but it's a little lighter than she expected.  It works really well for my needs and is well-made.  The only thing I wish was that it had a tab to adjust the volume, which it doesn't do.  She has this keyboard now for her iPad, but I can't imagine that"
Electronics_5,4,OR,"As many other people have reported, the vinyl is nice and heavy and very white. 9' x 20' is a great size for my studio.
I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll. So I had to re-roll the vinyl onto a cardboard core from a previous roll of seamless paper."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I Am Legend DVD

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.

This movie is based on the novelette&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>
Recommended for fans of Will Smith, and science fiction (Note:  I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the story follows the book.)

Books_5,3,OR,"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book."

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction."

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it."

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you.  There is also some swearing."

REALLY?
I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?
Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production.

I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and adventure.I like this movie very much.  I have watched it about 1,000 times, and I am not sure how many times it has been viewed by other people.  This movie was a good introduction to my daily routine.  I had some problems with the writing, but I thought it was good.  It's a good movie for a young person to watch.  I have no problems with the sound.

- beautiful paint and coloring, very true to life
- no open areas in the plastic so it can go in the bath with no risk of mold
- very good size compared to other ocean animal toys, so it has the feeling of being whale like!

It is pretty heavy and the fins are hard plastic. I suppose it could hurt to step on, or hit a sibling with, but this is a great whale shark. If you're a marine enthusiast I could see it working as a display for adult collectors as well since it's life-like (not cartoony)."

Jabba and the speeder looks way bettter in a new hope this time.  the emperor and boba fett are played by who they should be played by in empire strikes back.  and anakin appears as he appeared before he ceased to exist.  how could anakin have grown older.  as obi wan says anakin ceased to exist when he became vader.  ill admit it would be nice to have the originals as a bonus feature like on the alien quadrilogy discs, or at least have a comparison feature so you can see the original scenes that were changed like on Star Trek the motion picture, but the fact is the dvd makes all good changes, so stop whining about it."

It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet.

Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

But this new world isn't safe and when Agata gets the chance to finally have what she thinks she has wanted since she awakened may now be at her fingertips, now Agata will have to decide what she wants more, her home or her new life with Stian.

This was a really good read. Yes its shorter but this book wasn't rushed and I really, really enjoyed it. When I first read the book description I thought of Kristen Ashley's book Golden Dynasty and while they have a similar idea this is a story all on it's own. Stian was a great hero and like all of Ms. Snows hero's he was possessive, and strong, and me man you woman. Agata was a great heroine she didn't melt under pressure and she wasn't stupid. I also liked that she wasn't so stubborn that she missed what was right in front of her. All in all this was a really great read that was fast, hot, and new."

For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story.."

Its also a lot of fun to watch him be able to get all his energy out safely. I like the bright orange one so people can see Im still in control and I don't have a dog running around free.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like."

(If I could find Kwanzaa, Hannukah, Yule, or other winter solstice holiday romances I'd read those, too. ) Because I love themes of family and redemption that are so often present in these books. It's a fairy tale, but it's a fairy tale I really enjoy. Christmas in Snowflake Canyon brings me all the things I want in a holiday romance. It's got a disabled hero who is recovering from his injuries and the war that caused them (and an excellent presentation of disability), a heroine who absolutely has to grow up and comes to realize that on her own, matchmaking, and lots and lots of family fun. I'll be looking for more by RaeAnne Thayne."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

Books_5,5,CG,"1984 by George Orwell is a novel, with a distinctively dystopian plot that makes the reader feel as if they are the protagonists. The characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting.

I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ...

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

Still, I don't regret this purchase at all!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Works good as I had expected. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the driver with another one because the cover is very large.

The only thing that I like about this one is the price. I ordered two for the same door. I have two to keep in my car."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I didn't realize having a bigger cap would make my life so much easier! I don't have long hair, just a little longer than shoulder length but it's so much easier to keep my cap on now while swimming! Before, with rubber caps it was either a hit or miss on whether that day the caps would come off or not."

Kindle_Store_5,4,CG,This was a fantastic read.  I couldn't put it down.  This is a must read.I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it. The characters are well written and well developed. I look forward to reading more from this author.It was a good book and a good read

Movies_and_TV_5,5,CG,"I wish the studios would do more with the movie. I saw it for the first time and am so glad I did. I am a huge fan of Treme and it is so nice to see him in the movie. I am glad I did. This is a great movie for the whole family. I have watched it twice and I can't wait to see the next one. I love the ending. I have watched it many times. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it.I watched this movie with my son, who is 6 months old.  I am a big fan of the movies,"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,CG,"The pants are really comfortable and stretchy.  The fit is nice, the material is pretty.  The top is a nice, solid material, the waist is a bit loose, but it's okay.  The material is thin enough to be comfortable and soft enough to not be a problem.  I have a narrow chest and I can wear the pant with a medium/large.  I would recommend these pants to anyone with an A or B or C chest."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,CG,"Do I really need to go back and watch the entire movie?  Well, I don't.  If you want to watch a movie that is worth watching, you won't be disappointed.

The movie starts off fairly simple:  the protagonist, who has been given a job by a woman who is a failed singer, is recruited to work with a female singer who is a successful musician who has been given a job by a man who is an alcoholic.  The woman is shown to be a young woman who is trying to get a job and she is not able to find a job.  As the story goes, the woman has a dream.  It is a dream that she has and she does not understand.  When she sees the dream she realizes she is a failed singer and she is not the only singer in the world who is a failure.  This is what she wants and the dream is the only thing that she can do to get a job.  She has a lot of good qualities, but her dreams are not true.  The movie is very well done, with some very good performances by the women and some very bad ones.  The story is very well told and the acting is good.  The movie is also a good movie and the movie is a good one.  The ending is a little long, but you will enjoy it.  It is a very good movie.  The movie is very good and the movie is a good one.  If you like women's music, you will like this movie.I think I'd rather watch a movie"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"We thought these did seem to keep our cooler cold for a good amount of time.  We have one of the 5 day Coleman Coolers.  It is a $40 cooler, not one of the very expensive one.  I put all 4 of these Cooler Shock packs  and 4 ""blue ice"" packs in the cooler.  I did NOT use ice.  I then put in my food and water and placed in the trunk of my car.  The cooler stayed very cold for 48 hours and was adequately cold for the 3rd day.  On day 3 the cooler shock packs were mostly thawed out, but my salad and water was still cold.

So in a decent $40 cooler, I kept stuff cold for 3 days with a combination of 4 Cooler Shock and 4 Blue Ice packs.  This was during July in Florida.  So average daily temp was about 92 degrees."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I love these books! I love the way all 3 series groups inter-mingle each with the other.  All these characters are easy to love and their stories are gripping and keeps you interested through the end.

Books_5,2,OR,"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed.
If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing. If anything I hope this will turn a few people on to the lovely music of Chet Baker."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,CG,I am glad to see that the movie was released in the USA. The movie was one of the first movie I saw in a theater and I have enjoyed it so much I can now watch it over and over again. I will be watching it again soon. The series was well done. I liked the acting and the movie had a lot of action.

It's a good size, very comfortable.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the sneaker and it fits him so well.  He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time.  I got the black and it is exactly what I wanted.  I've only worn it twice, but I'm very pleased with it.Very nice work pants, especially for the price.  They are a bit tight around the waist and the pockets are a bit large for my size.  I like the color and style.  I received many compliments on them.Very nice shirt.  Very soft and warm.  I wore it to the beach and it didn't get hot.  I will probably buy another one of these in different colors.
The material is soft and breathable, so you can wear it with casual clothes or with a dress or a skirt.  It is a bit more expensive than expected, but it is worth it.I'm a fan of this dress!  I received it in a small"

Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"December 17th--""$99 for a stuffed animal?""  I'd say that it's a great purchase!  The other two we got were the ones with the bumper, and the ones with the other two.  Both of them were good size, and one was a little too big.  The one with the bumper was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I've had the same problem with the other one.  I think the two are the same size, and I'm not sure if that's because I'm smaller than the other, or because it's not just the bumper.  The other one is definitely bigger than the one with the bumper.  It's a fun little toy for little ones to play with.I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. She has a lot of fun with it. She was very happy with the purchase.This is a fun little game that I have been using in my family for some time now.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I give this 2 stars as I am not just throwing it out.

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.

Books_5,5,OR,"Crimson Eve, the 3rd book in Brandilyn Collins' Kanner Lake series, has been in my TBR stack for quite some time.  I read Violet Dawn (nicknamed Violent Dawn by my book club) and Amber Morn quite a while ago, but was not lost when I started this novel.  Really, they could probably be read as stand-alones, but I like to begin at the beginning.  The novel starts out running and really never quits.  Carla Radling is targeted by a hit man and is unsure just why someone wants her dead.  She literally stumbles into safety, but on the run, she can never be sure who to trust.  The story unfolds through present day action and the diary entries from Carla's 16 year old diary.  The switch between the two really works and the reader is not confused thanks to date entries at the top of chapters and a different font for the diary.  Crimson Eve is a good, quick read if you are looking for page turning suspense."

Yes, it takes a while.  I haven't timed it.  It's not burdensome.  You can walk around while you grind.  The directions are in English.  A helpful hint is to hold the handle in place while adjusting the grind.  Counterclockwise for coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have."

I spent many happy hours with Dalziel and Pascoe, Joe Sixsmith and numerous other characters. And I saved this last stand-alone novel for three years. It was so worth it. He is as usual brilliantly smart, witty, and desperately in love with English language. Alas, there is nobody out there with such a turn of phrase, with an uncanny ability to make words dance and twirl like a dozen of dervishes. So, it is over. Farewell Reg, you are sorely missed. Angels with you."

The harness goes on easily. My dogs get excited when I show them a harness -- they know they are going outside.

These harnesses are built to last. My old one is red with little paw prints (cute), which I don't think they make that color anymore. You can wash these harness in the washing machine and air dry.  I hope this company never goes out of business."

It is very comfortable to wear in a gym.  My husband is a large guy and the straps are too small for him to keep them in place.  He is a strong guy and will probably want to buy another one.

I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.Great product, great price. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding.

My wife and I have used them many times and we always use them. We have tried them on our mamma bike, and we always love them. They seem to be very durable and last much longer than any other brand we have tried. The material is very durable and the colors are very vibrant. It is really easy to adjust and change colors. I also think that the padding is a little snug for my wife and her wrist, but that is because she is in the wheelchair. She has tried a lot of different brands, but never had any issues with it.I've used these for about a year now and have been using them for a year and a half now.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Even though this book seems to talk about how to communicate a girl, I found that this book can be used for anyone for things other than ""seducing a girl"". Knowing how to communicate and how to use eye contact right is a skill that anyone should have. And I found a lot of great tips and fun exercises included in this book to help you train your eye contact and make it better and more powerful. The exercises in this book are definitely worth looking into. For example, Robert teaches you how to take a shower by alternating the temperatures of the water to train your eye contact, which is a bit challenging and fun to experiment. I've learned so much about ""high-status eye contact"" and am convinced by the book that it is so important for everyone to have this type of eye contact whenever we want to deliver powerful and persuasive messages."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,CG,"""Back and Back and Back Again,"" the movie's third act, which also features the first two episodes of the movie, is the most solid film in the genre, and it is especially effective with the five-star ratings.  The story is told in a rather simple and almost eerie way, with a great cast of characters and a good story.  The only problem is that the film is very short, with the first half of the film taking up most of the screen time.  The film is shot in a very small window, and the picture quality is quite poor.  There is a scene where a man is walking through the woods, and there is a scene where the sound of the woods is played to a loud and clear volume.  This is a very low-budget film, and it is likely that the story is not as good as the first film.  I don't know why the director was so reluctant to do this film.  The story is based on a true story of a man who, while in the woods with"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"Whereas this device is a little bulky, the materials are good enough. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

Mental illness is a terrible and sad fact of life, and the ripple effects on the people around someone who suffers from a mental illness can be devastating in the extreme.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire."

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd. For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end. A major bonus point for the author providing a list of glossary of terms so as to not confuse the reader, especially since if, like me, this is your first foray into the Watchmen series. It made it easy to catch up to speed. A fascinating tale, be sure to consider picking up a copy of Touch of Seduction"

I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

At one time, she was his law firm's private investigator, but after stepping into the legal-gray-area one too many times, he put her on probation with a stern warning that one more slip-up, she's out. What he doesn't know is that her ""questionable"" investigation uncovered a growing sinkhole in his personal life, one that could destroy his world...something he learns too late. And then what is the next right thing to do? A question both of them face.

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These cheater plugs are great. I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.

It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.

Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.

I was hoping to wear this for a wedding this weekend but thats not going to happen. I would say the sizing is more of a size 10. There were no labels on this except one on the inside that had a 5 on it. nothing else. no care instructions or anything. I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to. The inner material reminds me of slip material and it was clingy but that also might be because of the sizing..but it did seem to have quite a bit of static. The outer layer is a very thin see-through material. it is where the design in printed and it is very beautiful. the inner layer is about a foot shorter than the outer layer. The belt tie is my favorite part. It has beads and is made with real feathers.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.

So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.

It was shocking when the story was talking about planes and phones, that I got a wake up call this was a romance story for now. I personally thought  Hajar's reaction to his trauma was right on. People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"Reporter, Jeff Mann (James Cardwell) is busy blackmailing the local gangsters. Obviously, this is a dangerous undertaking for Mann, who quickly winds up deceased in his own office. Oh no! The assassin was disguised as well-known, masked crime-fighter, THE SHADOW! Now, the police are after the mysterious hero. Can THE SHADOW's alter-ego, Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) track down the real killer, before the police close in? BEHIND THE MASK is more comedic than I'd expected, as the original SHADOW was a dark, almost sinister persona, able to frighten the criminal element he was pursuing. In this film, THE SHADOW is rather marginalized, while the unmasked Cranston does the sleuthing. While I did like this movie well enough, it's mostly for laughs. So, don't expect the more traditional, serious SHADOW..."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this light not knowing what to expect so from the beginning:  Packing was great; the light arrives in a hard case that has fitted inserts that hold everything in place safely and comfortably, no hassle getting charger, light, and strap in and out. Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced. Thank goodness the flashlight has three light settings, I use the middle setting most of the time but its great to have options. Finally, the flashlight has a battery indicator that really comes in handy so I don't get caught short of charge."

I am 5'4"", 165lbs and these are perfect!  I would definitely recommend these shorts to anyone. This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster.

I have to say this thing has done exactly what I needed it to do.  B/w my wife and my two kids, there's no telling who will be feeding our dog day-to-day... I used the double sided tape to put it up on the garage wall above the dog food and it doesn't seem to matter who feeds her, we all consistently remember to slide the tab.  I didn't feel like the highest quality product when I opened it and the slider tabs do stick a little, but after 5 months of using this thing is has held up surprisingly well.  I've been impressed."

It is simple, it takes up small space, and temperature has worked spot-on for the first couple of months. It lays sideways, so you can put it low in the back of aquarium and not see it if you want. It has a nice temperature gage and different lights come on when it is in session. It is not digital, but really who cares? You should always have another thermometer in there to check. Have the one on your heater, and then one of the $1.50 ones you can get at any petshop. Who says your fancy digital one is correct you scummy digital heater buyers!"

I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one.

Thanks for the opportunity to read this book.  The author, Danielle Hutton, is a wonderful writer.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.  The first one was a bit predictable, the second one was a bit more interesting.  I really liked the first book, but I felt like there was too much emotion.  It's very hard to tell if a book is about a romance or a serial.  This one was a bit more of a romance/serial and a little more of a story.  I can't say enough about the characters.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Bought by Nicolette Hugo

Designation: Standalone, 302 pages

Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.

The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.

Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.

So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.

There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.

We've had these over a year now and they are still holding up well. In fact we've had some of the expensive Thomas brand tracks break but these are still going strong :-)"
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I purchased all three videos in the Fast Food series, a whopping 78 bucks.  First off I'd like to say they are informative, Mr. Novick lays out a nice little template to create low fat, healthy, vegan recipes.  It is quick and easy.  However, he didn't have to show every step, every time, too much repetition, wasted video time.  The production values are in the toilet, my  15 year old has produced better for youtube. I did like the pdf files for the recipes that I printed, that was a nice bonus, but not  worth the $24 I paid for each dvd! All in all, good info for those of us new to a plant based diet, but way too expensive."

But in fairness I don't Olivia set out to give us as much depth with the SR guys, but I think she is changing her mind. I really felt like we got into Kellen's head in this book, and I really did enjoy it ,but I did miss the nasty sex that I have to to expect from the SR guys. As always a great book and I love the way Olivia writes a book about each band member."

There were definitely surprises throughout which I thoroughly enjoyed.  What didn't I like about this book?  The intimate scenes were almost painful, very hokey.

I just finished this one and am only pausing long enough to tell you to get this book. If you haven't read this series, start with book 1 because you don't want to miss any of this! Love the characters! The book is about demons and demon-hunters, but it's also about the love and strength/power of families. I read....a lot!! I don't normally gush over the books I've read, but I'm making an exception here! This author knows how to bring a story to life!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading."

Books_5,5,CG,"Admittedly I am a huge fan of the author and her characters.  This book is a pretty good read.  I've read most of her other books and have enjoyed them very much.  This one is not one of those.  There are some very good parts.  The first part is about the woman who saves the man from the wolves and becomes the first wolf to ever kill a human.  The second part is about the two wolves who are a part of the story and the man who is one of the wolves.  I loved that part.

I read this book in two days.  I have read every one of the other books that I have read.  I enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read wolf stories.  It is a good story with lots of great characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case."

Books_5,5,OR,"I found the book to be very interesting and agree for the most part with the author.  However, I am not sure ALL murderers have had a bad upbringing where they were whipped or even abused.  I am sure there are cases where this is not so.  It would be interesting to examine more cases especially here in America.  I was raised by a half German and half English mom and was not abused much.  I turned out to be a happy and productive person.  I do not blame my mom for her abuses which were there but nobody is perfect and she grew up with the threat of the strap herself.  I do not see the purpose in blaming parents except in the cases described in the book.  To me I wonder if it is more of a German problem but I am probably nave to think that.  As stated in the book it is not limited to just one country.  I know from the parenting books out now (since I am a parent to two girls myself) in America the opposite is the case.  It is a fear to even raise a hand to a child because of the consequences.  Which is good.  My sister has perfectly mannered children who have never been harmed physically and I hope emotionally as well.  Although I do not know.  My children are not well behaved but they are allowed to be children and I try not to be permissive but it happens.  A very quick read for I read it in less than a week.  Nice read.  It kept me entertained.  A little too much on Hitler though and I did not care to read about the child murderer either."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"*I was given a copy of this book as a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!"

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review. I purchased the blue, and found it to be a lovely and soothing hue very much like the one pictured. I'm glad I tried it,  and I like it! It could use a better presentation, but the product turned out to be great!"

Kindle_Store_5,2,CG,Dirty Deeds only gets a few more pages with the third book in the series. I was hoping to get a part 2 before I read this one but the first one was a bit boring. The author had me on the edge of my seat. I love her characters and the way the book flowed. I loved how the heroine was able to write a believable story with a strong male lead.
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I sue these dogs beds as a liner for my dog's cots.  This is what I was looking for to place on top of the dog cots so they are not laying on the rougher mesh surface of the cot.  They fit the large cots well.  They are a too thin to use alone as a dog bed.  They fit well in a large wire kennel but they are still a little to thin for comfort for my older dogs.  I have not washed them but I tumble them in the dryer to freshen, fluff and remove dog hair."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"I love that it has a stretchy design, which is a nice bonus. I have one cat that loves to jump in the middle of the room, and the other is very picky. They both love the sound of the toy, and I love that it has two squeakers."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more."
Books_5,5,CG,"This third book in the series takes the story to a new level.  The characters are well developed and well developed.  I liked how the main characters were not so much strong as they were.  It was a good read.I can't imagine what to say about this book.  I'm not a fan of most of the books in the series.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I LOVE EM!.  I bought a size 8 and they fit fine but with no extra space at the heel and just a 1/4 inch of space between my toe and the edge of the shoe.  8.5 could have fit me too.  It would be a question of how you prefer your shoes to fit.  They are bouncy soft through the whole sole.  I am going to wear them for my entire vacation.  I will definitely buy another pair of artisan Clarks.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).
NOTES:  The sign outside the music store says ""8 Tracks"".  I feel so OLD!!  Speaking of, there are at least 2 terrific songs on the soundtrack, ""Got to believe in Magic"", ""King and Queen of Hearts"", etc.  Worth the price alone."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.

The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.

Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,CG,"In this film, which had been an award-winning film for a long time, the director has to explain that the film is not a typical film, but rather a tribute to the late director, Christopher Walken.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This is a very dense bone that is 5.5 inches long by about 2 inches wide.  My 80 lb greyhound loves it.  It's almost too big for him.  I do think it cleans his teeth because he has to work so hard gnawing at it to get even the tiniest chunk to come off the end.  He only gets through about half of this bone before he's full and tired.  Then I remove it and save it for the next day.  The 4 stars are because it's messy.  It leaves orangish debris on his bed that is sticky and gross, in my opinion, not his :-)  He'd give it a 10."

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright.

It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

This shirt has been the best i've worn so far - it makes me feel cooler more comfortable on the trail runs.
Please note size chart below; the information was provided by Saucony and it seems Runners like to feel larger than they actually are compared to the rest of the population; therefore, saucony's sizes will run smaller than most manufacturers sizes.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars."

Unfortunately, I own a Delta 8"" bench grinder and could only get three boltholes to line up. The fourth was on the rib of the base plate and could not be drilled. I mounted it with the three bolts and rubber grommets and all seems to be secure...considering.

This chair is very sturdy and it came with a small screw driver. I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the best price. I have a 11 year old daughter and she's on the road so I figured she'd just get a new one. But for the price, it's perfect. She can sit on it, but she can't sit on it, which is why she needs to sit on it.

I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much. I would recommend it overall."

Books_5,5,OR,"I had never heard of John ed Bradley when I picked up this book but I was absolutely delighted with every page. It is a haunting and lushly romantic story about an artist whose abundant talents and extraordinary charm couldn't compensate for the fact that he lived in an era with a dichotomous attitude about people of other races. Bradley writes with a deft hand about art and his story is rich with the scents and sounds of New Orleans, a city I love, but there is a haunting mournfulness in this tale that is both sad and seductive.

I especially appreciated his passages about the WPA murals, a particular interest of my own.

Bradley's characters are likeable and fully human and his prose is rich. The scene toward the end of the book where the paintings are found reminded me of the scene in A.S. Byatt's ""Possession"" when Christobel's letters are discovered in the doll's cradle. This is a very rich book and Bradley is a writer of considerable skill."

In 175 pages of rather well written prose about a rich woman I could never stand and from the viewpoint of her passive-aggressive attorney husband living in a snobby neighborhood of the famous Gold Coast of west Long Island, New York, let me tell you what happened.

Other than the narrator getting his ashes hauled a few times by his kinky, often emotionally unavailable wife, expressing a massively slow burn about his Mafia Don new neighbor, and the worlds shortest mid-life crisis, nothing has happened. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. He has described rich home after rich home, and some pleasant pieces of New York society historydropping a few names we know like Rockefeller, Rothchilds and so onother than that, zilch. Bupkis.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Combing the mythological stories of the Argonauts, with futuristic genetic manipulation, Kneupper has crafted an exciting sci-fi tale that reimagines an old story in a fantastic new way.
 Following the adventures of Jason, a super-soldier and product of the genetic code enhancements provided by Argo Corp, and genomancer Medea, Argonauts is faced paced, without skimping on immersive world building or short changing the plot.
 Argonauts is well-written clear, clean prose, strong characterization, and page turning action sequences. It is sure to be a welcome addition to the reading shelf of fans of Sci-fi, and bio-genetics in particular.
 My only criticism of this book is that I would have liked to see Medeas personality be a bit stronger. Im assuming shell have a growth arc later on, as it set up well for her to snap out of her lovesick behavior pattern. Her personality made the book read more like a YA to me, which may or may not have been his intention. Either way, could completely be a set up for future installments."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

Overall, Schwinn did a very good quality job with this bike and as usual, Amazon delivers to us in the most efficient ways. Thanks."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I've got to tell you, I'm tired of all the zombie stuff that is being put out today, but this movie was fantastic.  It is almost reminiscent of the original Scary Movie in that it doesn't just make random pop culture references but actually spoofs and parodies the source material.  Combining The Walking Dead, Zombieland, and Warm Bodies; this movie crafts a fun plot with great comedic timing and acting.  The throne in references to Shaun of the Dead and Dawn of the Dead with a splattering of other classic zombie movies makes this a great time for fans of zombies and is great for a laugh."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This was another mesmerising book about Shifter Grove and I thoroughly enjoyed the story;  it was a pleasure to read.  Danni feels betrayed by her boyfriend Taylor and moves to Shifter Grove, where it not only calls to her, but she is able to realise her dream.  Taylor doesnt give up though  he is relentless in his pursuit.  Danni, meanwhile, finds trust, friendship and love in Shifter Grove.  Rhett and Rush have returned home; they are billionaires but know that money cannot buy happiness.  They have made a promise to their father, and there is no way they can go back on this, irrespective of the consequences.  Danni has forgotten what it is like to date or how to get to know someone again after Taylor, but fate plays a hand although it is not all plane sailing.  This book was very well-written, and was a heart-warming and engaging story, which I would have no hesitation in recommending.  I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

Books_5,2,OR,"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.

The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?

Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end. My pulse quickly dropped after first 20 pages. My hair never raised and as I was reading the climax scene there was no earth movement.

I am sure the movie is coming soon too. If this happens then my hair will surely rise to the occasion."

I would recommend it to anyone who is into music. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how each of the characters came to meet and fall in love with one another. I will definitely be reading the other books in the series. This was a great book. It was written in a very well written style. I will definitely read the next book in the series. This is a great series and I look forward to seeing where the next book comes from.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This bag is working out perfectly for my wife in her new job. She never removes it from the wheels as it takes a couple minutes to convert over and isn't really hard to shoulder carry with the wheels.
Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this."

Then (because it did not occur to me to put the bowl on a high shelf) he very quickly chewed all the rubbery non-skid stuff off the bottom of the bowl. He is not really a problem chewer so I think something about this bowl is just too appealing for dogs to resist eating the whole thing.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is the first hydration system I have found that doesn't make your water taste like nasty chemicals.  I have previously used Camelbak and Platypus bladders, but each lent a disgusting plastic taste to my water.  I had taken to mixing Powerade with the water to try and cover up the taste.  We recently went on a week-long hiking trip in Peru, and I knew I wouldn't want to mix a sugary drink in my bladder to sip on all day, even if it was available.  So I purchased this Source/Deuter bladder and was not disappointed.  My water tasted like water even at the end of the day.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I needed extra pairs of these pants as I could only find one pair locally. The two pairs I received were both tagged the same. Neither pair fit like the pair I originally had. One pair I was barely able to get over my hips. There is about 1.5"" difference in the waist when held up together. The other pair is more snug than the pair purchased locally, but wearable. I am really wondering if these are factory seconds sold at full price???"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."

The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

I have to say I cannot wait for the next installment in the All About Love series. The author has really brought her A game to these books, so be prepared to enjoy with plenty of chocolate and tissues.

Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,"I had a chance to try out this game, I love the original game of life and have the board game and iOS game. This version for juniors is a let down. The game itself has promise but e construction of the board is cheap, the spinner compared to the original version is just terrible, and the cards you use some are really good like find the butterfly on the board or finish a jingle. But others are hard to u dear stand what you are supposed to do, and the rewards/penalty could easily be written clearly but ey use images and it's a bit hard to follow.

All in all yes you can play this game, but honestly I would pass on it. If they upped the quality, and didn't take shortcuts on the cards so it was easy to understand I'd say try it, but for now I have to say it's a don't buy."

What a fun love story this is!! Thinking her ""love"" life is done and over, Jordon isn't ready for her reaction to Blake. Upon meeting him she is rude and outright mean to him. It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself.
Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons.
The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call.
I really loved all the characters in this book. His parents, Dacy her BFF. This is one of a very few that made me cry happy tears. A job well done to the author.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"These are really cool! We had a little glow party outside and the adults got to wear these while the kids had glow stick necklaces. Well, that didn't last long because the kids ended up with the earrings and the glow sticks! They glow really bright and look awesome on! They are clip on earrings, so even if you don't have your ears pierced you can join in the fun! These earrings glow for hours! The only issue I found with them was getting them to stay together at first. It took a bit for them to stay in the connectors to be able to wear them. These are tons of fun!! My daughter even ended up using them as a bracelet at one point! So much fun!

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro. Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG. I did receive a complimentary unit for an unbiased review, but honestly they would have been my first choice for purchase anyway. They have a loyal customer in me though I would be sure to let you know if they dropped the ball in any way with their products."

I do not have the dolley, but I keep these around and in vehicles to hold tools an items that I don't want just sitting around loosely when being transported and I know what boxes contain different items so I can more conveniently move them around and stack them for organization. I need more of these, but I do think they are a bit pricey for being cases. A caution when stacking is that they aren't super secure when just clipped together.  If you're driving and only the bottom box is secured the top boxes may come off."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Working great for over a week.  My installation is a bit different.  I am using it to activate a WEMO switch to turn on 100+ feet of LED cafe lights outside.  I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2"" hole in the enclosure for the motion sensor to work.  It can not sense anything through plastic or glass.  A plastic bag was successful during testing, but not how I wanted to install it.  For additional weather proofing, I used silicon on areas prone to water intrusion.  To link the sensor to the WEMO switch, I just used IFTT(If this then that website)  and a simple rule mated them well.(If motion detected, then turn on wemo)

Works super.  Turns on lights as desired and sends IFTT alerts as well(though this is hit or miss it seems).

Also, this set up is working with Alexa(amazon echo) so I can say, ""Alexa, turn off cafe lights"" and she goes to work.

As a WIFI sensing device, I suppose the price is as expected, though I feel its more of a 20 something dollar device."

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We've all seen it...the mess in the trunk or under the seat.  For some reason wires just naturally find their way into nots, and having big heavy cable clamps on the ends doesn't help matters much.  Add to that the fact that your car won't start and your mood is deteriorating fast!  It's a recipe for disaster!  Well no longer!  Some finally invented something to save us from our frustrations.  The Arsenal cable organizer.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

It's very easy to put on and it seems to really help with his teeth. I have a vet who makes a lot of money and does a great job on dog teeth. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it. I would recommend this product for anyone with a dog with a sensitive tooth. I have used this for about a year and it still works. My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. I took it to the vet and he told me that he had found a new toy that was very different and I was worried that it was not a toy he would be able to play with. I took it back and it is a great toy for him. He loves it. He has a very picky eater and will eat anything and anything. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog loves this toy. I put him through his paces in the sandbox and have never seen him tear it apart. It is a great toy for a little girl with a long and strong coat."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This is a perfect little swing. We hung it up in our front yard in a little tree and my 6 and 4 year old have not left it alone. I have not seen one flaw with this swing. We plan on keeping it in our travel trailer for camping all summer. Very very pleased with this swing. I did receive it at a discounted rate in return for my review but I really do love it.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"PBS has a habit of running the entire Anne of Green Gables series on Thanksgiving Day (something other than football for the girls, I suspect!) and it never gets old. This is great entertainment (and learning) for the entire family. If you enjoyed the Laura Ingalls Series, the BBC Pride and Prejudice, or any of this genre, this series won't disappoint."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I am waiting somewhat patiently for Mr. Pattersons next novel.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Worth every penny.  This product will pay for it's self many times over.  Just the cost of going to the range, ammo and time.  Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.  When I do go to the range I expect to see big improvements and be able to stay in shape when I don't have time to shoot live.  Well worth the price for the convenience and realistic feel."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,Lightning fast shipping. Excellent customer service. Item was packaged well.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Works Great with all my battery candles of the same brand.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This really isn't even the same tool as the 2-ton cable puller.  I mean it is, but this thing is MASSIVE.  It weighs about 35 pounds and looks able to pull a house over.  The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Rips them a new one. Great blade for the price.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones. The main downside is you can find unbranded versions of these headphones for ~$20 on Amazon, still with Prime shipping."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"A Stairway to Danger is an intriguing novel filled with action and adventure from beginning to end. Tom and Will, two cousins living in a small town in the 1920s, become involved in a mystery when they find the body of the local deputy. Soon, they are investigating a mysterious barge on the river and becoming entangled in a dangerous adventure.

I found this novel to be reminiscent of the Hardy Boy series, except it is geared toward an older audience. The characters are well-thought out and realistic and the author gives the reader a good sense of the time period. Ben Woodard is an excellent writer who knows how to plot and plan a great adventure story."

The pieces in the ""dog"" ones are bigger & sometimes harder than the ones for cats. I do  have to break up the big pieces and eliminate the really hard ones, but it is such a good value that it seems worth the extra work.

edit 4/8/16- when I got towards the bottom of the bag some of the pieces were VERY hard and not usable for cats. Probably just fine for most dogs since they love chewing on even harder things like bones... but I think I will stick to the cat version for my cats in the future."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.
___________________________________

UPDATE--that third flashlight with the non-operational red LED's? It drained the batteries flat while turned off! Obviously a bad circuit. I threw it away. A 33% failure rate is nothing to brag about."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far."

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Zoe Michaels lives with her boyfriend, Chase Hilliard, and their two best friends, Brody McNamara and Tate Winslow. Zoe and Chase have an extraordinary sex life and often shared their most sensual sexual fantasies at night. After Zoe creates one of Chase's fantasies for his birthday, he decides to reciprocate with a fantasy involving additional men. He involves Brody and Chase in the adventure.

The title of the anthology (this story is included in Four Play) is appropriate for this story as it involves the relationship between the Zoe, Chase and their two roommates. It goes well beyond a menage scenario as they continue to explore other fantasies. Chase and Zoe are completely uninhibited but the relationships begin to strain after a while.

It's well written and the complexity of the characters make it interesting beyond the sexual exploits. This is as sexually explicit a story as I've ever read so take that as a warning if that makes you uncomfortable. The emotional strains placed on each of them will surprise you and draw you into the story. It is well done.

Note that characters from Seducing Simon appear in this story."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"As an individual who has dealt with a small cup size all my life, I am used to disappointment when purchasing bras. Even more so now that I have gained weight, and can't even find my size in a store. So, despite the glowing reviews of this bra, I was prepared for yet another bra with puckered, too-large cups, and an uncomfortable band. Surprise! It fits and is extremely comfortable. Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Legs came cracked slightly at first. The pieces were just too thin. I just got a couple of other ones
Books_5,4,OR,"I have an impersonal and ever-so-slight connection to the Johnson family (unbeknownst to them) and I was eager to read a 'family history'. This book is not really that. Although it does impart so knowledge and insight, I doubt this book is a sanctioned review of the Johnson heirs. This is the 2nd or 3rd book I've read about America's wealthy elite and sadly, they all sound tragically alike. People without jobs and direction flounder to find purpose in their lives. Few find it in the solace of religion or any other worthy, yet non-lucrative means. This book saddened me, although, being part of the working class population, I did find it somewhat fascintation to see 'how the other 1% lives'."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"DVD arrived on the date it was issued for the public, in perfect condition.
I now have all of the Harry Potter movies and love them as much as I loved reading the books."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Okay; homemade security camera? Check. Raspberry Pi media center? Check. Printer Server? Check. Hidden low power storage for the security camera? check that too. Unified way to power it all without a mess of cables? Now I can check that off too.

It works and works well. I have 4 Raspberry Pi based devices and 2 Unifi APs running of of this so far with out any issues."
